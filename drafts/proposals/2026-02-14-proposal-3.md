## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
Delta hedging is the dominant practical approach to managing option risk, yet the classical textbook rule (Black–Scholes delta) is derived under frictionless trading and constant volatility. In reality, hedgers face transaction costs, discrete rebalancing, and time-varying volatility and skew. These frictions create a sequential decision problem: how much to hedge *now* depends on expected future volatility, expected rebalancing costs, and risk preferences.

Recent work in “deep hedging” and reinforcement learning (RL) treats hedging as a control problem and learns policies that directly optimize hedging objectives under costs and constraints. A promising idea is to enrich the hedger’s state with information from the implied volatility surface, which embeds forward-looking market expectations and can be predictive of future risk.

**Research question:** *Does an RL-based hedging policy that conditions on implied volatility surface features (level, skew, term structure) outperform classical delta hedging in out-of-sample hedging P&L once transaction costs are included?*

The economic payoff is clear: better hedging policies reduce trading costs and tail risk for dealers and asset managers. The research also contributes to understanding whether option-implied information is economically useful for real-time risk management beyond simple volatility proxies.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (max 1 page)
Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973) imply a delta-hedging strategy in continuous time under constant volatility. Empirically, volatility is stochastic and implied volatility surfaces exhibit systematic dynamics across strikes and maturities, which influence hedging outcomes. Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997, *Review of Financial Studies*) show that richer dynamics improve pricing, implying that hedging based on misspecified models can generate systematic P&L.

The ML literature proposes both pricing-focused models and hedging-focused models. Deep hedging (Buehler et al., 2019) formulates hedging as an optimization problem in discrete time and uses neural networks to learn hedging strategies under transaction costs and constraints. Recent extensions incorporate reinforcement learning and risk-sensitive objectives. For example, policy-gradient RL has been used to hedge S&P 500 options while integrating implied volatility surface feedback information, with improved performance especially when transaction costs matter. Distributional RL has been applied to multi-greek hedging (gamma/vega), emphasizing tail outcomes rather than mean error.

Separately, research shows that option-implied variables are informative for expected returns and risk premia (Goyal & Saretto, 2009, *Review of Financial Studies*). If the implied volatility surface contains forward-looking information, incorporating surface features into the hedger’s state should improve hedging decisions.

This proposal builds on these insights and provides an empirical test using a transparent RL setup with IvyDB data, focusing on out-of-sample performance net of transaction costs.
A related practical concern is that classical delta hedging ignores the informational content of the entire surface: two days can share the same ATM IV but differ markedly in skew and term structure, implying different downside risk and future volatility. By feeding these surface summaries into the RL state, the policy can adapt hedging aggressiveness to forward-looking market conditions rather than relying on backward-looking realized volatility alone.
This directly tests whether option-implied expectations can be operationalized into a rule that reduces hedging losses net of costs.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words, must include regression equations)
### 3.1 Environment and state
I model hedging a short option position (e.g., short 1 SPX call/put) over a horizon of \(T\) days with discrete rebalancing. At each day \(t\), the hedger chooses the hedge position \(h_t\) in the underlying (or ETF proxy) given state \(s_t\).

State variables include:
- Underlying price and returns \((S_t, r_{t-1:t})\)
- Option characteristics \((k_t=\ln(K/S_t), \tau_t)\)
- Implied volatility surface features (constructed from IvyDB):
  - **Level:** ATM 30-day IV
  - **Skew:** 25-delta put minus call IV (or slope around ATM)
  - **Term structure:** 90D IV minus 30D IV
- Liquidity proxies (bid–ask spreads, open interest)

### 3.2 Objective and reward
Let the marked-to-market hedged portfolio value change be:
\[
\Delta V_{t+1} = P_{t+1}-P_t - h_t(S_{t+1}-S_t) - TC(h_t,h_{t-1}).
\]
Transaction costs are proportional:
\[
TC(h_t,h_{t-1}) = c\,S_t\,|h_t-h_{t-1}|.
\]
The RL reward is negative risk-adjusted loss. A baseline choice is mean-variance:
\[
R_{t+1} = \Delta V_{t+1} - \eta (\Delta V_{t+1})^2,
\]
where \(\eta\) controls risk aversion; robustness will use CVaR-style objectives.

### 3.3 Policy class and training
The policy \(\pi_\theta\) maps states to hedge actions: \(h_t=\pi_\theta(s_t)\). I will compare:
- **Benchmark (BS delta):** \(h_t=\Delta^{BS}_t\)
- **Practitioner delta:** delta from market IV with smoothed surface
- **RL policy:** actor-critic or policy-gradient method trained on historical episodes.

To avoid leakage, training and evaluation use strict time splits: train on early years, validate hyperparameters, and test on later years.

### 3.4 Econometric evaluation
Primary test compares realized hedging outcomes. For each option-day, compute hedging P&L \(\Pi_{i,t+1}\) under each strategy. Panel regression:
\[
\Pi_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta\,\mathbb{1}(RL) + \gamma'Z_{i,t} + \delta_{\tau}+\delta_m+\delta_t + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}.
\]
I also compare tail metrics (VaR/CVaR) and turnover. A key hypothesis is \(\beta>0\) (higher P&L, i.e., lower hedging loss) net of costs.

### 3.5 Mechanism test: role of IV surface information
To test whether IV surface features matter, I will train restricted RL policies excluding surface variables and compare performance:
\[
\Pi^{RL(full)} - \Pi^{RL(no\ IV)}.
\]
If the surface truly adds forward-looking information, performance should degrade meaningfully when these features are removed.

### 3.6 Calibration of transaction costs and constraints
Transaction costs will be calibrated using IvyDB bid–ask spreads on the underlying hedge instrument (SPY or SPX proxy) and a proportional fee component. I will run a grid of cost levels (low/medium/high) to assess whether RL gains are robust or only appear in frictionless settings. Position limits will cap the hedge ratio to a reasonable interval (e.g., [-2,2]) to mimic margin and risk constraints faced by practitioners.

### 3.7 Robustness: alternative objectives and out-of-sample stability
Hedgers care about tail risk, not only variance. I will therefore re-train policies using (i) a CVaR-style reward that penalizes the worst 5% of outcomes, and (ii) drawdown-based penalties. I will report whether RL improvements persist across objectives, and whether the learned policy remains stable (low turnover and similar actions) when applied to unseen years. To guard against overfitting, I will use rolling-window training (e.g., 5-year train, 1-year validate, 1-year test) and compare performance across multiple non-overlapping test windows.

### 3.8 Interpreting the policy: what does the RL agent learn?
To make results interpretable, I will analyze how hedge ratios vary with IV level, skew, and term structure. For example, I will estimate a post-hoc regression of the learned action on state variables:  h_t = a + b1*Level_t + b2*Skew_t + b3*Term_t + controls + u_t. If the policy increases hedging when skew steepens (indicating crash risk), this provides an economic narrative linking option-implied information to dynamic risk management.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words, must include descriptive statistics table)
**Primary data:** OptionMetrics IvyDB US (via WRDS). **Access is verified** (Tilburg University WRDS subscription confirmed). IvyDB provides option quotes, implied volatilities, Greeks, volume, open interest, and underlying identifiers.

**Universe and sample:**
- Baseline: SPX options (liquid index options with deep cross-section).
- Maturity buckets: 7–60 days (primary), with extensions to longer maturities.
- Filters: positive bid, spreads below a threshold, sufficient open interest.

**Feature construction:** Daily IV surface features (level/skew/term) are constructed from the cross-section using either (i) a parametric surface fit, or (ii) a deep smoothing approach as a robustness check. This ensures the RL agent has economically meaningful state variables.

**Descriptive statistics (template; computed from IvyDB):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P25 | Median | P75 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Option mid price (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Log-moneyness ln(K/S) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Time-to-maturity (days) |  |  |  |  |  |
| ATM 30D IV (%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Skew (25D put − call, IV pts) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bid–ask spread (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Hedge turnover |  |  |  |  |  |

**Practical feasibility:** IvyDB supports daily backtests with transaction cost modeling using bid–ask spreads. Training RL policies requires careful time splits and simulation of episodes; this is feasible with standard RL tooling and the daily data frequency.
