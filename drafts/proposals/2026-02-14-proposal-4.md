## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
Option markets are often viewed as informationally efficient because options are actively traded by sophisticated participants and because no-arbitrage relationships tightly restrict prices across strikes and maturities. Yet, in practice, option quotes are noisy, market frictions exist, and supply–demand effects can generate temporary deviations from “fair” values. If these deviations can be measured reliably, they may imply economically meaningful trading opportunities—or, alternatively, they may simply reflect compensation for risk and transaction costs.

Recent work proposes end-to-end deep learning approaches that learn trading signals directly from option market data without imposing a structural pricing model. This raises a classic finance question in a modern setting: is there *predictable* mispricing in option markets that survives realistic costs?

**Research question:** *Can machine learning models identify option mispricing that predicts subsequent option (or delta-hedged option) returns, and can a trading strategy based on these signals generate positive risk-adjusted performance after transaction costs?*

The economic importance is twofold: (i) it provides evidence on option market efficiency in the presence of modern ML tools, and (ii) it informs whether ML-based signals can be useful for systematic options strategies implemented by institutional investors.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (max 1 page)
Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973) provide the baseline no-arbitrage pricing framework, but empirical option prices embed volatility smiles and time-varying risk premia. Work such as Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997, *Review of Financial Studies*) highlights the need for richer dynamics to fit the cross-section of option prices.

A large literature studies option-implied information and the predictability of option returns. For instance, Goyal and Saretto (2009, *Review of Financial Studies*) study the cross-section of option returns and volatility. These studies emphasize that trading profits must be evaluated after accounting for transaction costs, bid–ask spreads, and risk exposures.
A further practical perspective comes from market microstructure and limits-to-arbitrage arguments: option markets are segmented, many participants hedge dynamically, and inventory and margin constraints can cause temporary price pressure. Mispricing, if it exists, is therefore likely to be short-lived and more visible in less liquid strikes/maturities or during stressed periods when hedging demand is one-sided. This implies that any empirical design must explicitly account for liquidity (spreads, open interest) and must evaluate whether predictability survives in the most liquid subset where implementability is realistic. It also motivates using delta-hedged returns as the primary outcome, because raw option returns are dominated by underlying moves and risk premia.

Machine learning has recently been applied to both option pricing and options trading. Deep learning can map market state variables to option prices (or implied volatilities) and can also be trained end-to-end to generate trading signals. A recent end-to-end approach for options trading reports improvements in risk-adjusted backtest performance and highlights the importance of turnover regularization under high transaction costs.

However, evidence on whether ML finds *true mispricing* versus proxies for risk is still limited. This proposal explicitly separates (i) statistical predictability, (ii) economic profitability net of costs, and (iii) risk-adjusted performance using standard factor controls.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words, must include regression equations)
### 3.1 Measuring mispricing
Define a model-implied “fair value” \(\widehat{P}_{i,t}\) for option \(i\) at day \(t\) using an ML pricing model trained on a large panel. Mispricing is:
\[
MP_{i,t} = \frac{P_{i,t} - \widehat{P}_{i,t}}{P_{i,t}},
\]
or alternatively in implied volatility units.

I will use multiple models for robustness: gradient boosting, neural networks, and an arbitrage-aware surface model. The purpose is not to claim a single “true” fair value, but to test whether deviations from a flexible, data-driven benchmark predict future returns.

### 3.2 Return definitions
I consider two outcome variables:
1. **Raw option returns:** \(R^{opt}_{i,t+1}\) from mid quotes.
2. **Delta-hedged returns:**
\[
R^{dh}_{i,t+1} = (P_{i,t+1}-P_{i,t}) - \Delta_{i,t}(S_{t+1}-S_t) - TC_{i,t},
\]
where \(TC\) includes option and hedge transaction costs.

### 3.3 Predictive regressions
The core predictive regression is:
\[
R_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta\,MP_{i,t} + \gamma'Z_{i,t} + \delta_{\tau}+\delta_m+\delta_t + \varepsilon_{i,t+1},
\]
where \(Z_{i,t}\) includes implied volatility, vega, bid–ask spreads, and open interest. A positive \(\beta\) implies that options that appear underpriced (negative MP) subsequently earn higher returns, consistent with mispricing correction.

### 3.4 Portfolio formation and strategy backtest
Each day, sort options into deciles by mispricing and form a long–short portfolio (long “underpriced”, short “overpriced”), with equal-weighting within bins and risk limits (e.g., delta-neutral and vega constraints). Portfolio return:
\[
R^{LS}_{t+1} = \sum_{i\in L_t} w_{i,t}R_{i,t+1} - \sum_{i\in S_t} w_{i,t}R_{i,t+1}.
\]
Transaction costs are applied using bid–ask spreads from IvyDB and turnover penalties.

### 3.5 Risk adjustment
To ensure profits are not compensation for known risks, regress portfolio returns on standard factors:
\[
R^{LS}_{t} = a + b\,MKT_t + c\,VOL_t + d\,SMB_t + e\,HML_t + u_t,
\]
where \(VOL_t\) is a volatility factor (e.g., changes in VIX or variance risk premium proxy). The intercept \(a\) measures abnormal performance.

### 3.6 Decomposing mispricing vs risk compensation
A key identification concern is that apparent mispricing may proxy for priced risks (jump risk, volatility risk, tail exposure) or liquidity. I will therefore compute exposures such as delta, gamma, vega, and theta and include them in predictive regressions. I will also evaluate whether signals predict returns *after delta hedging* and after controlling for volatility-factor proxies. If predictability survives these controls, it is more consistent with mispricing rather than compensation for systematic risk.

### 3.7 Transaction costs and implementability
Option strategies are highly sensitive to bid–ask spreads and turnover. I will implement a conservative cost model that uses the full bid–ask spread on entry/exit for the option leg, plus proportional costs for the delta hedge. Portfolio formation will include turnover constraints and a minimum-liquidity threshold. I will also evaluate capacity by restricting to high open-interest contracts and reporting average dollars traded per day.

### 3.8 Robustness: alternative horizons and cross-sectional structure
I will test multiple holding horizons (1 day, 5 days, 20 days) and will examine whether predictability is concentrated in specific option buckets (short-dated, OTM puts, high skew periods). I will also run a Fama–MacBeth two-step procedure to quantify whether mispricing is a priced characteristic in the cross-section. Finally, I will compare the ML-based mispricing signal to simpler baselines such as deviations from a smoothed IV surface (SVI) to verify that results truly require ML rather than classical surface fitting.

### 3.9 Model validation and overfitting safeguards
Because option panels are large and highly autocorrelated, preventing overfitting is crucial. I will use strict time-based splits and evaluate signals only on held-out periods. Hyperparameters will be chosen on a validation window and then frozen. I will also report performance degradation when the model is trained on fewer years, and I will run a reality-check style procedure by comparing to randomly permuted mispricing signals to ensure results are not artifacts of data snooping.
As an additional check, I will compute strategy returns using next-day execution at bid/ask (worst-case) to approximate realistic implementation.
This keeps the profitability claims conservative.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words, must include descriptive statistics table)
**Primary data:** OptionMetrics IvyDB US (via WRDS). **Access is verified** (Tilburg University WRDS subscription confirmed). IvyDB provides daily option bid/ask quotes, implied volatilities, open interest, and trading volume.

**Auxiliary sources:**
- Underlying returns and firm characteristics: CRSP (WRDS).
- Risk factors: Fama–French factors (WRDS) and volatility proxies (VIX).
- Risk-free rates: Treasury yields.

**Sample design:**
- Universe: SPX options and/or S&P 100 equity options.
- Filters: remove extremely illiquid contracts (high spreads, low OI), exclude zero bids.
- Use mid quotes for signal computation; apply bid–ask costs for strategy returns.

**Descriptive statistics (template; computed from IvyDB):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P25 | Median | P75 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Option mid price (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bid–ask spread (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Implied volatility (%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Open interest |  |  |  |  |  |
| Daily option return (%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Delta-hedged return (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |

**Feasibility:** IvyDB provides the option panel needed to estimate ML fair values and to simulate trading strategies with transaction costs. WRDS also provides the factor data required for risk-adjusted evaluation.
