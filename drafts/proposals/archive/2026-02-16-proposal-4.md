## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
Implied volatility surfaces (IVS) summarize option market expectations across strikes and maturities. While many studies fit the surface cross‑sectionally, fewer evaluate whether forecasting the surface’s *dynamics* yields economic value. Recent ML work proposes compressing the full surface into latent factors (e.g., via VAEs) and using these factors for downstream pricing; other papers propose physics‑informed calibration procedures that handle sparse and noisy grids. The practical motivation is clear: if tomorrow’s surface can be forecasted better, a desk may price, hedge, and manage inventory more effectively.

**RQ:** *Can representation learning methods (VAE and/or Transformer sequence models) forecast the evolution of the SPX implied volatility surface, and do these forecasts improve out‑of‑sample option pricing and hedging outcomes relative to benchmark surface‑dynamics models (PCA/AR) once transaction costs are considered?*

This question is economically important because volatility regime shifts drive large P&L and risk. A forecasting model that anticipates changes in IV level, skew, and term structure can improve hedging timing and inventory valuation. The thesis will therefore connect statistical forecasting metrics to economic performance measures, using OptionMetrics IvyDB US data via WRDS (access verified).

## Part 2 — Literature Review (MAX 1 page)
Black‑Scholes (1973) implies constant volatility; empirically, implied volatility varies across strike and maturity, motivating stochastic volatility and jump risk. Practitioners model IV surfaces daily and often use low‑dimensional factor representations (e.g., level, slope, curvature; PCA) to summarize the surface.

A recent, highly relevant ML pipeline is *Deep Learning Option Pricing with Market Implied Volatility Surfaces* (Ding, Lu, & Cheung, 2025), which constructs arbitrage‑free IV surfaces from SPX end‑of‑day options, compresses the surface with a VAE into a low‑dimensional latent vector, and feeds latent variables into a neural pricer for American/Asian options. This paper motivates using *surface representation learning* as a core building block.

Constraint-aware calibration work such as *Whack‑a‑mole Learning* (Hoshisashi, Phelan, & Barucca, 2024) stresses that surface estimation is multi‑objective: fit sparse quotes while satisfying PDE/no‑arbitrage restrictions. For dynamics and scenario realism, *FuNVol* (Choudhary, Jaimungal, & Bergeron, 2023) combines functional PCA and neural SDEs to model multi‑asset IV evolution, suggesting modern stochastic process tools.

In forecasting, Transformer architectures have shown strong performance in time‑series prediction, including volatility forecasting evidence in recent applied studies. The thesis will synthesize these strands: (i) build arbitrage‑free surfaces, (ii) learn latent representations, (iii) forecast latent states with sequence models, and (iv) test whether forecasting translates into pricing/hedging improvements.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words; include regression equations)
### 3.1 Step 1: Build daily arbitrage-aware IV surfaces
Using IvyDB end‑of‑day SPX option quotes, I will construct a standardized grid in \((\Delta,\tau)\) or \((\ln(K/F),\tau)\). I will apply smoothing and remove obvious quote errors, then enforce static no‑arbitrage constraints (at minimum via penalties) to obtain an “arbitrage‑aware” surface each day.

### 3.2 Step 2: Learn low-dimensional representations
**VAE approach:** Train a variational autoencoder on daily surfaces to obtain latent vectors \(z_t \in \mathbb{R}^d\) that reconstruct the surface. Evaluate reconstruction error and whether latent dimensions align with economic factors (level/skew/term structure).

**Benchmark representation:** PCA factors on the same standardized surface grid.

### 3.3 Step 3: Forecast latent dynamics
Forecast \(z_{t+1}\) (or multi‑step \(z_{t+h}\)) using:
- AR(1) / VAR on PCA or VAE latents
- LSTM baseline
- **Transformer encoder** on sequences \(z_{t-L:t}\) and macro/market controls (e.g., VIX, realized volatility)

### 3.4 Step 4: Translate forecasts into economic tasks
**Pricing task:** Use the forecasted surface \(\widehat{\sigma}_{t+1}(K,\tau)\) to price a set of options at t (valuation of inventory). Evaluate absolute pricing error vs realized mid quotes at t+1.

**Hedging task:** Use forecasted Greeks (from forecasted surface) to form hedge ratios and evaluate hedging P&L for short option positions. Compare to hedges based on today’s surface only.

**Economic channel.** A surface forecast can add value through at least two channels:
1. **Inventory valuation:** a dealer marking inventory at time t may be closer to the next day’s market if the IVS forecast anticipates level/skew moves.
2. **Risk management and timing:** if the model predicts increased skew steepening or term-structure shifts, the hedge can adjust earlier, potentially reducing tail losses.

To keep the analysis implementable, I will focus on liquid European-style contracts (or treat near‑maturity American features as small for SPX European settlement), and I will standardize evaluation on a fixed set of maturities and delta buckets.

### 3.5 Regression equations (economic value)
**(A) Surface forecast accuracy:** define a surface error metric (grid RMSE):
\[
SE_{t+1} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^G \left(\widehat{\sigma}_{t+1,g} - \sigma_{t+1,g}\right)^2}
\]
Compare models by mean and by tail performance (P95).

**(B) Pricing error regression:**
\[
|PE_{i,t+1}| = \alpha + \phi\,\mathbb{1}\{\text{Transformer}\} + \beta_1 \text{BidAsk}_{i,t+1} + \beta_2 \text{Moneyness}_{i,t+1} + \beta_3 \text{TTM}_{i,t+1} + u_{i,t+1}
\]
where \(\phi\) captures whether Transformer-based forecasts reduce pricing errors conditional on microstructure.

**(C) Hedging performance:** compute net hedging loss (including costs) and test whether forecast-based hedges reduce tail losses:
\[
\text{Loss}^{net}_{i,t} = -\Pi_{i,t} + \lambda \cdot \text{Turnover}_{i,t}
\]
Compare distributions across hedging rules and regress losses on regime controls (VIX).

### 3.6 Identification, baselines, and robustness
**Baselines.** In addition to AR/VAR and LSTM, I will include a simple “random walk” forecast (tomorrow’s surface equals today’s) because it is a strong benchmark in volatility. This ensures that any ML gains are measured against a meaningful baseline.

**Robustness.**
- Alternative latent dimension d and window length L; ablate macro controls (VIX, realized vol) to see whether the model truly learns from the surface itself.
- Stability across calm vs crisis periods; report performance separately in high‑VIX episodes.
- Enforce no‑arbitrage post‑processing on forecasted surfaces (or train with penalties) to avoid economically invalid predictions.
- Compare forecasts in IV space vs price space, because errors can look different when scaled by vega.

### 3.7 Additional regression tests (linking forecasts to market outcomes)
To connect surface forecasts to economically meaningful variables, I will test whether predicted surface changes relate to realized future option returns and hedging losses. For example, for a standardized ATM IV factor forecast \(\widehat{\Delta \sigma}^{ATM}_{t+1}\):
\[
R^{opt}_{t\to t+1} = \alpha + \beta \, \widehat{\Delta \sigma}^{ATM}_{t+1} + \gamma\,\Delta \text{VIX}_{t+1} + \varepsilon_{t+1}
\]
This assesses whether the forecast contains information beyond contemporaneous volatility indices.

### 3.8 Feasibility and computational plan
The surface grid will be standardized (e.g., 5–10 maturities × 10–20 delta buckets). This keeps the VAE/Transformer training feasible while still capturing skew and term structure. I will use rolling re‑estimation (e.g., monthly retraining) to mimic a realistic forecasting deployment.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words; include descriptive statistics table; confirm access)
**Primary data:** **OptionMetrics IvyDB US via WRDS (access verified).** Daily SPX option quotes, implied volatilities, and underlying index levels.

**Supplementary data:** risk‑free rates and VIX (WRDS). These controls allow forecasting models to condition on volatility regimes. I will also compute realized volatility from the underlying index returns and include it as an additional control and benchmark predictor.

**Sample and filters.** The initial sample will span multiple years (subject to WRDS extraction limits) and will be restricted to options with reliable quotes (non‑zero bids, minimum open interest/volume, and reasonable moneyness bounds). Because sparse grids are common for long maturities and far OTM strikes, I will evaluate models both on a dense “core” grid (liquid region) and on an extended grid (including less liquid areas) to test whether representation learning helps in the sparse region.

**Construction variables:**
- Forward price \(F_t\) from put–call parity.
- Moneyness \(\ln(K/F_t)\) or delta buckets.
- Time to maturity (days).

**Descriptive statistics (template)**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P5 | P50 | P95 | N |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ATM 30d IV |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| IV skew (25Δ put − call) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Term structure (90d−30d) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Surface reconstruction error |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Forecast surface error |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bid-ask spread |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The final thesis will report these overall and by regime, and will additionally summarize model hyperparameters (latent dimension, training window) and compute correlations between learned latent factors and economically interpretable IV factors (level, skew, term structure). This helps interpret whether the model learns stable “risk state variables” rather than purely statistical components, in a reproducible appendix.
