## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
Equity index options are priced and hedged in practice with models that assume frictionless trading and simplified dynamics. Yet, the economic value of any pricing model is ultimately determined by its *hedging* performance once transaction costs, discrete rebalancing, and volatility regime changes are taken seriously. Recent machine learning (ML) approaches report lower pricing RMSE than Black–Scholes-type benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether these statistical gains translate into economically meaningful improvements in hedging outcomes when markets are noisy and trading is costly.

**Research question:** *Do machine learning option pricing models deliver superior out-of-sample hedging performance relative to Black–Scholes once transaction costs and realistic rebalancing constraints are incorporated?*

I will answer this by (i) training ML pricing models to predict option prices (or implied volatilities) from standard state variables, (ii) converting predicted prices into hedging deltas (via automatic differentiation or numerical sensitivities), and (iii) comparing the distribution of delta-hedged P&L across models under multiple rebalancing frequencies and transaction-cost schedules.

**Economic importance:** If ML improves hedging efficiency, it reduces hedging costs for market makers and institutional investors and can alter equilibrium option spreads and liquidity provision. If ML only improves in-sample pricing but not hedging, its economic value is limited and adoption should focus on risk management or surface smoothing rather than trading.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (max 1 page)
Classical option pricing begins with Black and Scholes (1973, *Journal of Political Economy*) and Merton (1973), which imply closed-form prices under lognormal dynamics and constant volatility. Empirically, implied volatility smiles and term structure effects contradict constant volatility, motivating stochastic volatility and jump risk models. Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997, *Review of Financial Studies*) show that incorporating stochastic volatility and jumps improves pricing performance across option moneyness and maturities.

A parallel literature studies how option markets embed information and risk premia, and how option-implied variables relate to expected returns. For example, Goyal and Saretto (2009, *Review of Financial Studies*) study the cross-section of option returns and the role of volatility, providing a clear benchmark for economically meaningful performance metrics beyond raw pricing error.

Recent work applies ML to option pricing and implied volatility surface representation. One theme is *architecture and inductive bias*: gated neural networks propose structure (“rationality by design”) that improves generalization and stability versus generic multilayer perceptrons. A second theme is *constraints*: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) incorporate the pricing PDE; constrained deep learning embeds payoff boundary conditions for joint pricing/hedging in incomplete markets; and neural market models attempt to maintain no-arbitrage properties (e.g., arbitrage-free Neural-SDEs). These approaches aim to reduce overfitting and to align ML with financial theory.

Finally, hedging can be treated as a sequential decision problem. Deep hedging (Buehler et al., 2019) and follow-up RL work (including policy-gradient methods and distributional RL for gamma/vega hedging) optimize hedging objectives under costs and constraints. However, many ML pricing papers still evaluate success via RMSE rather than *hedging P&L with transaction costs*, leaving an open question: does better ML pricing actually yield better economic outcomes?

This proposal fills that gap by directly connecting ML pricing models to hedging performance under realistic trading frictions.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words, must include regression equations)
### 3.1 Empirical design
I will run two linked empirical exercises:
1. **Pricing exercise:** Compare out-of-sample pricing accuracy for Black–Scholes (with implied vol as input) versus ML models that learn the price (or implied vol) mapping from covariates.
2. **Hedging exercise:** Use each model’s implied delta to implement a delta-hedged strategy and evaluate hedging P&L distributions *including transaction costs*.

### 3.2 ML pricing specification
Let option *i* at day *t* have features
\[
X_{i,t} = (\ln(K/S)_{i,t},\; \tau_{i,t},\; r_t,\; q_t,\; RV_t,\; IV\_level_t,\; IV\_skew_t,\; IV\_term_t,\; \text{spread}_{i,t},\; OI_{i,t}).
\]
Targets are either mid price \(P_{i,t}\) or implied volatility \(\sigma^{IV}_{i,t}\). An ML estimator \(\hat f(\cdot)\) yields
\[
\widehat{P}_{i,t} = \hat f(X_{i,t}).
\]
Deltas are computed by differentiating \(\widehat{P}_{i,t}\) with respect to the underlying \(S_t\):
\[
\widehat{\Delta}^{ML}_{i,t} = \frac{\partial \widehat{P}_{i,t}}{\partial S_t}.
\]
For neural networks this is obtained via automatic differentiation; for tree-based models I will use finite differences on \(S_t\) while keeping other covariates fixed.

### 3.3 Hedging P&L with transaction costs
For each option-day observation, form a one-day delta-hedged position
\[
\Pi^{(k)}_{i,t+1} = P_{i,t+1} - P_{i,t} - \widehat{\Delta}^{(k)}_{i,t}(S_{t+1}-S_t) - TC_{i,t}^{(k)},
\]
where \(k \in \{BS, ML\}\). Transaction costs are modeled as proportional costs on the hedge rebalancing:
\[
TC_{i,t}^{(k)} = c \cdot S_t \cdot \left|\widehat{\Delta}^{(k)}_{i,t} - \widehat{\Delta}^{(k)}_{i,t-1}\right|,
\]
with \(c\) calibrated to plausible half-spreads/fees and varied for robustness.

### 3.4 Hypotheses and regressions
The main hypothesis is that ML reduces expected hedging loss and tail risk relative to Black–Scholes:
\[
H_0: \mathbb{E}[\Pi^{ML}] \le \mathbb{E}[\Pi^{BS}]\quad\text{vs}\quad H_1: \mathbb{E}[\Pi^{ML}] > \mathbb{E}[\Pi^{BS}].
\]
I estimate panel regressions of hedging outcomes on a model indicator and controls:
\[
\Pi_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta \cdot \mathbb{1}(ML) + \gamma'Z_{i,t} + \delta_{\tau} + \delta_{m} + \delta_t + \varepsilon_{i,t+1},
\]
where \(Z_{i,t}\) includes liquidity (spread), vega, and option type; \(\delta_{\tau}\) are maturity fixed effects; \(\delta_m\) are moneyness bins; and \(\delta_t\) are date fixed effects capturing market-wide shocks. Standard errors will be clustered by date and contract.

### 3.5 Additional evaluation metrics
Beyond mean P&L, I will report (i) variance of \(\Pi\), (ii) downside risk (5% VaR and CVaR), (iii) turnover of hedge positions, and (iv) performance across volatility regimes (e.g., pre/post-VIX spikes). This makes the results interpretable for economically relevant risk management.

---

### 3.6 Robustness: alternative deltas and model risk
A central concern is that ML may fit prices well but yield unstable deltas (high turnover). I will therefore (i) evaluate delta smoothness via the time-series volatility of estimated deltas, (ii) cap hedge trades with position limits, and (iii) compare against a practitioner benchmark that uses market-implied volatility with cross-sectional smoothing across strikes/maturities. I will also test whether gains concentrate in specific regions (short-dated or deep OTM options), where microstructure and jump risk are most severe. Finally, I will run a placebo test where deltas are randomly perturbed to quantify how sensitive hedging performance is to delta estimation error.
Additionally, I will compare results using alternative cost models (fixed per-trade fees and bid-ask half-spread estimates) and report results separately for calm versus crisis periods to assess regime dependence.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words, must include descriptive statistics table)
**Primary data:** OptionMetrics IvyDB US (via WRDS). **Access is verified** (Tilburg University WRDS subscription confirmed). IvyDB provides end-of-day option quotes (bid/ask), implied volatilities, Greeks, open interest, trading volume, and underlying identifiers for U.S. equity and index options.

**Auxiliary data (WRDS):**
- Risk-free rates: U.S. Treasury yields mapped to maturities.
- Underlying returns and dividends: CRSP (or OptionMetrics underlying files).
- Market conditions: VIX (CBOE) for regime splits; realized volatility computed from underlying returns.

**Baseline sample:** SPX options, 2010–2025. Filters remove contracts with zero bids, extreme spreads, very short maturity (e.g., \(<7\) days) where microstructure dominates, and stale quotes. Prices use mid-quotes; moneyness and maturity are binned for fixed effects.

**Why IvyDB is appropriate:** (i) it includes the full option panel needed to evaluate cross-sectional and time-series variation, (ii) it contains liquidity measures (bid–ask spreads) required for transaction cost modeling, and (iii) it provides implied vol and Greeks to construct Black–Scholes benchmarks and sensible ML features.

**Descriptive statistics (template; will be computed from IvyDB):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P25 | Median | P75 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Option mid price (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Log-moneyness ln(K/S) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Time-to-maturity (days) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Implied volatility (%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bid–ask spread (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Open interest |  |  |  |  |  |
| Absolute delta |  |  |  |  |  |
| Vega |  |  |  |  |  |

**Feasibility and computing:** All variables are available through WRDS. The main computational burden is training ML models on a large option panel; this is feasible with standard Python ML libraries. Hedging backtests are straightforward once the delta series is computed.
