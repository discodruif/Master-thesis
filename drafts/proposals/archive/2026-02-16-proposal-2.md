## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
In liquid index option markets, most hedging in practice is still benchmarked against delta hedging (possibly “smile‑adjusted” deltas). However, hedging is a sequential decision problem under discrete trading, stochastic volatility, and transaction costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) and deep hedging approaches propose learning a hedging policy directly by optimizing an economic objective. A crucial open question is whether these methods improve *implementable* performance when transaction costs are accounted for, and which state variables matter.

**RQ:** *Does incorporating implied volatility surface (IVS) feedback as a state variable in RL-based hedging policies reduce hedging losses and tail risk (CVaR) net of transaction costs relative to (i) practitioner delta hedging, (ii) smile‑adjusted delta hedging, and (iii) RL policies without IVS state information?*

This question is economically important because hedging quality affects dealer risk capital, margin requirements, and the viability of volatility‑targeting strategies. If IV surface dynamics contain forward‑looking information about volatility and skew changes, then an RL policy that conditions on the IV surface may better time rebalancing intensity and strike exposure, improving hedging outcomes particularly during regime shifts. The thesis will deliver a transparent, empirically grounded comparison focused on SPX options with realistic trading frictions using OptionMetrics IvyDB US (access verified).

## Part 2 — Literature Review (MAX 1 page)
The foundational benchmark is the Black‑Scholes delta hedge (Black & Scholes, 1973), which is theoretically optimal only under continuous trading and model assumptions that fail empirically (stochastic volatility, jumps, discrete trading). Stochastic volatility models (Heston, 1993) improve fit but still require frequent recalibration and may not capture complex state dependence.

The *deep hedging* literature reframes hedging as direct optimization of a terminal loss/utility function with discrete trading and market frictions. Buehler, Gonon, Teichmann, and Wood (2019, *Quantitative Finance*) propose learning hedging strategies using neural networks, emphasizing that “best hedge” depends on objective (variance, VaR/CVaR, utility) and costs.

Recent work highlights the role of implied volatility surface information. François, Gauthier, Godin, and Pérez Mendoza (2024) explicitly integrate IVS dynamics into a policy‑gradient RL hedging framework for S&P 500 options and find improvements over practitioner and smiled‑implied delta hedges, especially with transaction costs. This suggests that *state design*—what the agent observes—can be as important as the learning algorithm.

Complementary strands study practical RL hedging setups and robustness, including model‑free deep hedging with explicit transaction costs and limited data requirements (arXiv working papers, 2025), and “fast and robust” deep hedging designs focusing on computational stability. Together, these works motivate an empirical thesis contribution: quantify the incremental value of IV surface features in real data and test whether gains concentrate in specific regimes (high VIX), maturities, or moneyness buckets.

A practical issue emphasized in the literature is that an RL hedge can look impressive in simulations but degrade once realistic constraints are added: discrete trading, position limits, and microstructure costs. Therefore, evaluation should focus on *distributional* hedging outcomes (tail losses) and on stability across subperiods rather than a single average RMSE. This thesis will translate these methodological insights into an empirical design suitable for IvyDB option panels: a transparent set of baselines, explicit transaction cost accounting, and a regime‑aware comparison that directly links IVS dynamics to hedging decisions.

The thesis aligns with top-journal themes in asset pricing and market microstructure (e.g., RFS/JFE/JFQA style evidence standards): economic value must be evaluated out‑of‑sample and net of costs, with robust inference and clear benchmarking.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words; include regression equations)
### 3.1 Hedging setting
I will focus on hedging short positions in SPX options (calls and puts) using the underlying index (or SPY proxy if needed) with discrete rebalancing (daily baseline; robustness to higher frequency if feasible). For each option contract i initiated at date t0, I will simulate a hedged portfolio held until a horizon H (e.g., 5 trading days) or until maturity for shorter maturities.

### 3.2 Policies to compare
1. **Practitioner delta hedge:** \(\Delta^{BS}\) using Black‑Scholes with quoted IV.
2. **Smile‑adjusted delta hedge:** use deltas implied from an arbitrage‑free fitted IV surface (baseline surface model).
3. **RL/Deep hedging without IVS state:** state includes underlying return/level, realized volatility proxy, time‑to‑maturity, moneyness, and previous hedge position.
4. **RL/Deep hedging with IVS state:** augment state with IV level, skew measures, term‑structure slope, or compressed IV surface factors (e.g., PCA factors).

### 3.3 Objective functions and constraints
The RL agent chooses hedge ratio \(h_{t}\) (shares of underlying per option) subject to position limits \(h_t \in [h_{min},h_{max}]\). The hedged P&L over horizon is:

\[
\Pi_{i} = C_{i,t_0} - C_{i,t_0+H} + \sum_{t=t_0}^{t_0+H-1} h_t (S_{t+1}-S_t) - \sum_{t=t_0}^{t_0+H-1} \text{TC}(\Delta h_t, S_t)
\]

where TC captures transaction costs, e.g.
\[
\text{TC}(\Delta h_t,S_t)= \lambda \cdot |\Delta h_t|\cdot S_t
\]
with \(\lambda\) based on half‑spread + slippage.

The training loss can be variance minimization, or risk‑averse loss such as CVaR at level \(q\):
\[
\min_{\pi} \; \text{CVaR}_q(-\Pi_i)
\]
where \(\pi\) is the policy mapping states to hedge ratios.

### 3.4 Econometric evaluation using regressions
After computing hedging outcomes for each method m, I will estimate panel regressions of hedging loss to isolate when IVS information helps:

\[
\text{Loss}_{i,t}^{(m)} = \alpha_m + \beta_1 \text{VIX}_t + \beta_2 |r_{t}| + \beta_3 \text{Skew}_{t} + \beta_4 \text{Moneyness}_{i,t} + \beta_5 \text{TTM}_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\]

and an interaction specification:
\[
\text{Loss}_{i,t}^{(m)} = \alpha_m + \theta \; \mathbb{1}\{m=\text{RL+IVS}\}\times \text{VIX}_t + \cdots
\]

The coefficient \(\theta\) tests whether the IVS‑augmented RL policy delivers disproportionate benefits in stressed volatility regimes.

### 3.5 Robustness and feasibility
- Compare horizons (1 day, 5 days) and rebalancing frequency (e.g., end‑of‑day vs additional rehedges when the market moves materially).
- Alternative transaction cost models (half‑spread vs full spread; add fixed fee; stress higher spreads in crises).
- Evaluate distributional statistics: mean loss, volatility of loss, P95 loss, and \(\text{CVaR}_{5\%}\).
- Out‑of‑sample design: train on early years, validate on an intermediate window, and test on a held‑out recent period.

### 3.6 Additional tests (economic interpretation)
**When does IVS information help?** I will compute “marginal value of information” by comparing RL+IVS vs RL‑no‑IVS in matched samples. For example, I will run regressions where the dependent variable is the *difference* in hedging loss between the two RL policies:

\[
\Delta \text{Loss}_{i,t} = \text{Loss}^{(\text{RL+IVS})}_{i,t} - \text{Loss}^{(\text{RL})}_{i,t}
\]

and explain it with regime variables (VIX, realized volatility), and IV dynamics (changes in skew and term structure). This makes the contribution interpretable: it tests whether IVS features act as a proxy for latent volatility state changes that are not captured by past returns alone.

**Benchmark surface construction.** Because smile‑adjusted deltas require a surface, I will build a baseline arbitrage‑free IV surface each day (e.g., via smoothing + no‑arbitrage constraints) and compute deltas consistently across methods. This avoids attributing differences to inconsistent Greeks.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words; include descriptive statistics table; confirm access)
**Primary data:** **OptionMetrics IvyDB US via WRDS (access verified).** Variables: option bid/ask/mid, implied volatility, open interest, volume, delta (if provided), strike, maturity, option type; underlying index level; and corporate actions adjustments as needed.

**Auxiliary data (WRDS):** risk‑free rates (Treasury), VIX (or a volatility index series), and potentially CRSP for underlying returns.

**Feature engineering for IVS state:**
- Level factor: ATM IV for a benchmark maturity (e.g., 30 days).
- Skew factor: difference between 25‑delta put IV and 25‑delta call IV.
- Term structure: IV(90d) − IV(30d).
- Optional: PCA factors of a standardized IV grid.

**Transaction costs:** computed from bid‑ask spreads; hedging trades assumed executed at mid ± half‑spread (baseline) and at worse prices for robustness. Results will be reported both gross and net of costs.

### Descriptive statistics (template)
A descriptive statistics table (overall and by regime) will be included:

| Variable | Mean | Std | P5 | P50 | P95 | N |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Option mid price |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bid-ask spread |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Implied volatility (ATM 30d) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| IV skew (25Δ put − 25Δ call) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Time to maturity (days) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
