## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
American-style options are challenging because the holder can exercise early, making valuation a high-dimensional optimal stopping problem. In practice, American equity options are widely traded and appear in portfolios where early-exercise risk matters, especially under dividends and stochastic volatility. Classical approaches such as least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) are flexible but can be computationally expensive and sensitive to basis choice. Recent machine learning approaches propose using neural networks to approximate continuation values, compute price bounds, or embed the pricing PDE via physics-informed training.

A particularly appealing strand uses neural networks to compute *simultaneous upper and lower bounds* on American option prices while also producing hedging strategies, avoiding nested Monte Carlo. This enables an economic interpretation: the width of bounds measures model uncertainty and can inform risk management.

**Research question:** *Can neural network methods deliver tighter American option price bounds (and more effective hedging strategies) than classical LSM-style benchmarks, and do these improvements translate into economically meaningful hedging performance under transaction costs?*

This is economically important because more accurate and faster American pricing reduces model risk and hedging error for option market makers and improves risk management for institutions holding early-exercise exposures.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (max 1 page)
The no-arbitrage foundation comes from Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973). While European options have closed-form solutions under simple dynamics, American options require solving an optimal stopping problem and often depend on numerical methods.

Empirical work emphasizes that richer dynamics (stochastic volatility, jumps) improve option pricing performance (Bakshi, Cao, & Chen, 1997, *Review of Financial Studies*), which implies that American option pricing errors can be large when models are misspecified.

Classical American pricing methods include lattice methods and simulation-based approaches like least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM), which estimates continuation values via regression. Machine learning extends this idea by using flexible function approximators. Recent papers propose neural network approaches that (i) learn continuation values, (ii) embed PDE structure via physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), or (iii) compute upper and lower price bounds along with hedging strategies using neural networks without nested simulation. These approaches aim to reduce computational burden and improve accuracy in higher dimensions.
The benchmark simulation-based approach is Longstaff and Schwartz (2001, *Review of Financial Studies*), which uses least-squares regression to approximate the continuation value as a function of state variables. LSM is widely used because it scales better than trees in higher dimensions, but it requires choosing basis functions and can yield noisy exercise boundaries. Theoretical work on dual representations of American option prices (upper bounds via martingales) motivates computing both lower (primal) and upper (dual) bounds; bound-based evaluation is attractive because it avoids over-reliance on a single point estimate. Neural network methods can be seen as replacing the ad-hoc basis in LSM with a flexible function approximator, and, when designed carefully, can also produce martingale controls that generate tight upper bounds. This proposal leverages that viewpoint: the key performance metric is not only pricing error but the tightness of bounds and the stability/turnover of the associated hedging strategy.

In finance, model evaluation should emphasize not only pricing RMSE but also hedging implications and economic robustness. Linking ML American pricing methods to hedging P&L and transaction costs provides a clear economic test of their practical value.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words, must include regression equations)
### 3.1 Experimental design
I will evaluate American option pricing methods in two settings:
1. **Simulation setting:** Generate paths under benchmark models (GBM, stochastic volatility, jump-diffusion) where high-quality reference prices are available.
2. **Empirical setting:** Use U.S. equity American options (OptionMetrics IvyDB) and compare model-implied prices/bounds to market prices and to hedging outcomes.

### 3.2 Methods
**Benchmark:** LSM (least-squares Monte Carlo) as the classical baseline.

**Neural network bound method:** Use a neural network approach that produces lower and upper bounds \((\underline{P}_{t}, \overline{P}_{t})\) and a hedging strategy \(h_t\). The goal is to minimize the bound gap while satisfying martingale/supermartingale constraints.

Bound width metric:
\[
BW_{i,t} = \overline{P}_{i,t} - \underline{P}_{i,t}.
\]

### 3.3 Pricing error and bound tests
Compare market mid price \(P^{mkt}_{i,t}\) to bounds. A practical sanity check is whether \(P^{mkt}\) lies within the estimated bounds. Define an indicator:
\[
I_{i,t} = \mathbb{1}(\underline{P}_{i,t} \le P^{mkt}_{i,t} \le \overline{P}_{i,t}).
\]
I will test whether the neural method yields tighter bounds while maintaining high coverage.

### 3.4 Hedging evaluation
Construct a hedged portfolio using the strategy produced by each method. One-step hedging P&L net of costs:
\[
\Pi^{(m)}_{i,t+1} = P^{mkt}_{i,t+1} - P^{mkt}_{i,t} - h^{(m)}_{i,t}(S_{t+1}-S_t) - c\,S_t\,|h^{(m)}_{i,t}-h^{(m)}_{i,t-1}|.
\]
Panel regression to compare methods:
\[
\Pi_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta\,\mathbb{1}(NN\ bounds) + \gamma'Z_{i,t} + \delta_{\tau}+\delta_m+\delta_t + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}.
\]
A positive \(\beta\) implies improved hedging performance.

### 3.5 Mechanisms and robustness
- Analyze whether improvements are larger for deep ITM options (where early exercise is more relevant) and around ex-dividend dates.
- Test sensitivity to transaction cost level and rebalancing frequency.
- Compare the bound width and hedge turnover (stability) across methods.

### 3.6 Formal optimal stopping setup
Let the payoff be g(S_t) (e.g., for an American put, g(S)=max(K-S,0)). The American option value satisfies
V_t = max( g(S_t),  E_t[ e^{-rDelta t} V_{t+1} ] ).
LSM approximates the continuation value C_t(S_t)=E_t[e^{-rDelta t}V_{t+1}] by regression. Neural approaches replace the regression basis with a network C_	heta(S_t, X_t).

### 3.7 Bound construction and evaluation
Lower bounds come from an exercise policy (stopping rule) and simulated cash flows. Upper bounds can be obtained from a dual representation using martingales. The NN bound method I study (Guo, Langrené, & Wu, 2023) learns networks that jointly produce (i) an exercise policy / continuation approximation and (ii) a control variate/martingale term for the dual bound. Empirically, I will evaluate (a) average bound width BW, (b) coverage of market prices by bounds, and (c) whether bound widths are economically sensible (e.g., wider in high-volatility regimes).

### 3.8 Linking bounds to hedging and model risk
A practical advantage of bounds is that they quantify pricing uncertainty. I will test whether wider bounds predict larger subsequent hedging losses (a form of model-risk measure). Specifically, I will estimate
|Pi_{i,t+1}| = a + b*BW_{i,t} + controls + fixed effects + u_{i,t+1}.
If b>0, bound width is an economically meaningful proxy for risk in the hedging problem.

### 3.9 Robustness and comparison to simpler ML methods
To ensure results are not specific to one architecture, I will compare against (i) a straightforward neural continuation-value approximation without dual bounds, (ii) a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that enforces the Black–Scholes PDE in a simplified setting, and (iii) a strong LSM baseline with alternative basis functions and regularization. I will report runtime, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and performance across moneyness/maturity buckets. Special attention will be paid to contracts near dividend dates where early exercise incentives are strongest.

### 3.10 Empirical focus: dividend-induced early exercise
Early exercise is most relevant for American calls on dividend-paying stocks and for deep ITM puts when interest rates are high. Using CRSP dividend event data, I will tag ex-dividend windows and test whether NN methods deliver larger improvements in those windows. This creates a clear economic channel: methods that better learn the exercise boundary should perform best exactly when early exercise incentives are strongest.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words, must include descriptive statistics table)
**Primary data:** OptionMetrics IvyDB US (via WRDS). **Access is verified** (Tilburg University WRDS subscription confirmed). IvyDB includes U.S. equity option quotes, implied volatilities, Greeks, and underlying identifiers.

**Universe:** U.S. equity options with American exercise features (excluding European-only index options where appropriate). Focus on liquid underlyings to ensure implementability and reliable quotes.

**Auxiliary data:**
- CRSP underlying returns and dividend events (WRDS).
- Risk-free rates (Treasury yields).

**Descriptive statistics (template; computed from IvyDB):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P25 | Median | P75 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Option mid price (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Log-moneyness ln(K/S) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Time-to-maturity (days) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Dividend yield (%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bound width (USD) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Coverage indicator I (share) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Hedge turnover |  |  |  |  |  |

**Feasibility:** IvyDB provides the required option panel; CRSP supplies dividends critical for early exercise incentives. Simulation experiments can be run to validate methods before applying to market data.
