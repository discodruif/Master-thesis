## Part 1: Research Question

Can meta-learning approaches that leverage information across trading days and market regimes achieve faster and more accurate calibration of option pricing models compared to traditional daily re-calibration methods, particularly during regime transitions and periods of market stress?

The economic significance is clear: option pricing models (both parametric and neural network-based) require daily calibration to match observed market prices. Traditional approaches treat each day as an independent calibration task, ignoring valuable information from historical patterns and cross-regime dynamics. This leads to slow convergence, overfitting, and poor performance during regime shifts when historical data from the current regime is scarce.

Meta-learning, or "learning to learn," offers a fundamentally different paradigm: train a model across many calibration tasks such that it can rapidly adapt to new market conditions with minimal data. This research investigates three specific questions: (1) Can meta-learned pricing models calibrate faster (fewer iterations, less data) than standard approaches? (2) Do meta-learned models generalize better to out-of-sample days, especially during volatility regime changes? (3) What are the economic gains (reduced mispricing, better hedging) from improved calibration speed and accuracy?

This work bridges machine learning innovation with practical derivatives market needs, offering tools that could transform real-time pricing and risk management systems.

## Part 2: Literature Review

Model calibration is a central challenge in derivatives pricing. Traditional parametric models (SABR, Heston) require solving complex optimization problems daily to match market-observed option prices (Hagan et al., 2002, *Wilmott Magazine*; Heston, 1993, *Review of Financial Studies*). These calibrations are computationally expensive and often unstable, particularly when market conditions change rapidly (Cont & Tankov, 2004, *Financial Modelling with Jump Processes*).

Neural network approaches have shown promise for accelerating calibration. Horvath et al. (2021, *Quantitative Finance*) demonstrate that neural networks trained as surrogate pricing engines can dramatically reduce calibration time for stochastic and rough volatility models. However, these methods still require substantial training data from each specific market regime, limiting their effectiveness during transitions.

Meta-learning addresses this limitation by training models to quickly adapt to new tasks. Finn et al. (2017, *ICML*) introduce Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), which optimizes model initialization such that fine-tuning on new tasks requires minimal gradient steps. This approach has been successfully applied to few-shot learning problems across domains (Hospedales et al., 2021, *IEEE TPAMI*).

Recent work has begun applying meta-learning to finance. The 2025 paper on Volatility Neural Process with SABR-induced priors (*arXiv*) frames implied volatility surface construction as a meta-learning task, learning across multiple trading days to improve surface predictions. This work demonstrates that meta-learning can leverage cross-day information while respecting financial constraints.

However, the literature lacks comprehensive evaluations of meta-learning for option pricing model calibration, particularly regarding: (1) performance during volatility regime transitions (low-to-high vol, vice versa), (2) economic impact on pricing and hedging errors, and (3) comparison against state-of-the-art neural network baselines. This research fills these critical gaps.

## Part 3: Research Plan

The research employs a meta-learning framework based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) adapted for option pricing calibration.

**Meta-Learning Framework**

Consider a pricing model $f_\theta$ parameterized by $\theta$ that maps option characteristics $(K, T, S, r)$ to prices or implied volatilities. Traditional calibration on day $i$ solves:

$$
\theta_i^* = \arg\min_\theta \sum_{j=1}^{N_i} \left(P_j^{\text{market}} - f_\theta(K_j, T_j, S_i, r_i)\right)^2
$$

where $N_i$ is the number of observed options on day $i$.

Meta-learning instead optimizes for rapid adaptability. In the MAML framework, we seek initialization $\theta_0$ such that after $K$ gradient steps, the model performs well on new days:

$$
\theta_0^* = \arg\min_{\theta_0} \sum_{i=1}^M \mathcal{L}_i\left(\theta_0 - \alpha \nabla_{\theta_0} \mathcal{L}_i(\theta_0)\right)
$$

where $M$ is the number of training days (tasks), $\mathcal{L}_i$ is the calibration loss on day $i$, and $\alpha$ is the adaptation learning rate. This bi-level optimization trains the model to find parameter regions where small adjustments rapidly minimize calibration error.

**Empirical Implementation**

The meta-training procedure operates as follows:
1. Sample a batch of $B$ days from the training period (2019-2022)
2. For each day $i$, split observations into support set (calibration) and query set (evaluation)
3. Perform $K=3$ gradient steps on the support set starting from $\theta_0$
4. Evaluate adapted parameters $\theta_i'$ on the query set
5. Update $\theta_0$ to minimize average query loss across the batch

**Regime Transition Analysis**

To evaluate robustness during regime changes, I construct a regime classification based on VIX levels:
- Low volatility: VIX < 15
- Medium volatility: 15 ≤ VIX < 25
- High volatility: VIX ≥ 25

The regime transition performance regression is:

$$
\text{Calibration Error}_{t} = \delta_0 + \delta_1 \text{MetaLearned}_t + \delta_2 \text{RegimeChange}_t + \delta_3 (\text{MetaLearned} \times \text{RegimeChange})_t + \varepsilon_t
$$

where $\text{RegimeChange}_t$ is a dummy for days following a regime shift. The interaction term $\delta_3$ tests whether meta-learning provides extra benefits during transitions. I hypothesize $\delta_3 < 0$, indicating that meta-learned models adapt faster to new regimes.

**Economic Impact Evaluation**

To assess economic significance, I evaluate downstream pricing and hedging performance:

$$
\text{Hedging P\&L Variance}_{i,t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{MetaCalibration}_{i,t} + \beta_2 \text{Greeks}_{i,t} + \beta_3 \text{Vol}_{t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
$$

Better calibration should reduce hedging errors, reflected in $\beta_1 < 0$.

## Part 4: Data Sources

The primary dataset is **OptionMetrics IvyDB US** via WRDS, for which Tilburg University has verified institutional access.

The sample focuses on **S&P 500 index options (SPX)** from 2019-2024:
- Training period: 2019-2022 (1,000+ trading days across multiple regimes)
- Validation: 2023 (for hyperparameter tuning)
- Testing: 2024 (out-of-sample evaluation including regime transitions)

This period provides rich variation:
- Low volatility baseline (2019, VIX avg ~13%)
- High volatility shock (Mar-Apr 2020, VIX peaked at 82%)
- Recovery and normalization (2021)
- Inflation-driven volatility (2022, VIX 20-35%)
- Recent dynamics (2023-2024)

Each trading day constitutes a meta-learning "task" with typically 2,000-5,000 liquid option contracts providing training signal.

**Descriptive Statistics** (projected sample, SPX options 2019-2024):

| Variable | Mean | Std Dev | Min | Max | Observations |
|----------|------|---------|-----|-----|--------------|
| Options per Day | 3,250 | 1,100 | 800 | 8,500 | ~1,500 days |
| Calibration Time (sec, standard) | 45.2 | 18.5 | 12.0 | 180.0 | ~1,500 days |
| Calibration RMSE (%) | 1.85 | 0.92 | 0.30 | 8.50 | ~1,500 days |
| VIX Level (%) | 19.85 | 9.12 | 9.14 | 82.69 | ~1,500 days |
| Regime Changes (count) | 0.08 | 0.27 | 0 | 1 | ~1,500 days |
| Pricing Error (%, next day) | 2.12 | 1.45 | 0.15 | 12.30 | ~1,500 days |

Regime classifications are based on VIX levels obtained from CBOE and merged with the OptionMetrics dataset. Additional macroeconomic controls (federal funds rate, term spread) from FRED will be included as contextual features.
