## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
The implied volatility (IV) surface is the central state variable in modern options markets. Practitioners quote and mark options in IV, hedge portfolios using IV dynamics (level, skew, term structure), and many volatility trading strategies depend on reliable measurement of changes in the surface. A practical issue is that option quotes are sparse, noisy, and arrive in irregular “point clouds” that differ from day to day and intraday. Dealers therefore require a procedure to *nowcast* a smooth, stable, arbitrage-consistent surface from the quotes currently available.

Classical parametric approaches (e.g., SVI-style fits) are interpretable and fast but can become unstable in stressed markets or when the cross-section is uneven. Recent deep learning work proposes neural-operator architectures that map irregularly sampled quotes directly to a full surface while enforcing no-arbitrage constraints and reducing heavy per-day preprocessing.

**Research question:** *Do arbitrage-aware deep learning methods (neural operators / constrained networks) produce implied volatility surfaces that (i) exhibit fewer static arbitrage violations, (ii) forecast future IV dynamics better, and (iii) improve downstream pricing and hedging outcomes relative to parametric benchmarks?*

Economically, improved surface estimation reduces model risk for market makers and lowers hedging costs for institutional investors. If the surface forecasts improve, the result also provides a testable channel for economically meaningful volatility trading signals.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (max 1 page)
The canonical framework for option pricing is Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973), but observed option prices imply volatility smiles and term structure that violate constant-volatility assumptions. A rich empirical literature models these patterns with stochastic volatility and jumps; Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997, *Review of Financial Studies*) demonstrate that richer dynamics materially improve pricing performance across strikes and maturities.

In practice, the object of interest is often the *implied volatility surface*, not a single price. The surface must be smooth and consistent with static no-arbitrage conditions (e.g., call prices are decreasing and convex in strike). Dealer workflows commonly rely on parametric representations (such as SVI-like fits) and calibration routines that are repeated frequently. While powerful, these methods can be sensitive to initialization, local minima, or changing cross-sectional availability of quotes.

Machine learning has increasingly been used to model option prices and volatility surfaces. Architectures with inductive biases can improve generalization (e.g., gated networks for option pricing), and several approaches embed financial structure through constraints (no-arbitrage, boundary conditions, PDE restrictions via physics-informed neural networks). A recent strand targets the practical “point cloud” problem: operator deep smoothing for implied volatility uses neural operators (graph neural operator architecture) to directly map observed quote sets into a full surface, emphasizes robustness to subsampling, and explicitly enforces critical constraints.

Finally, there is strong motivation to evaluate surface models by *economic usefulness* rather than only interpolation error. Option-implied variables relate to expected returns and volatility risk premia (e.g., Goyal & Saretto, 2009, *Review of Financial Studies*). If deep learning yields cleaner measurement of IV factors (reducing measurement error) and better forecasts, it should improve hedging and the performance of systematic strategies built on surface movements.

This proposal therefore evaluates surface models along three dimensions: financial consistency (arbitrage), statistical accuracy (forecasting), and economic outcomes (pricing/hedging).

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words, must include regression equations)
### 3.1 Surface construction problem
Let \(\sigma^{IV}_{t}(k,\tau)\) denote implied volatility as a function of log-moneyness \(k=\ln(K/S)\) and maturity \(\tau\). At each day \(t\) we observe a sparse set of quotes
\[
\mathcal{D}_t = \{(k_{j,t},\tau_{j,t},\sigma^{IV}_{j,t},w_{j,t})\}_{j=1}^{n_t},
\]
where \(w_{j,t}\) is a quality weight (e.g., inverse spread or volume/open interest).

The goal is a fitted surface \(\widehat{\sigma}^{(m)}_t(k,\tau)\) on a fixed grid \(\mathcal{G}\) for model \(m\).

### 3.2 Models and estimation
**Benchmark 1 (parametric):** Fit a standard parametric smile/surface (SVI-like) per maturity and connect across maturities, with standard penalties for smoothness and constraints.

**Benchmark 2 (classical ML):** Fit a supervised model \(\sigma^{IV}_{j,t}=g(X_{j,t})\) with engineered features \(X_{j,t}=(k_{j,t},\tau_{j,t},RV_t,VIX_t,r_t,\ldots)\) and then interpolate on \(\mathcal{G}\).

**Proposed model (deep learning surface / operator):** Train a model \(f_\theta\) that maps the set \(\mathcal{D}_t\) to a grid surface:
\[
\widehat{\sigma}^{DL}_t(\mathcal{G}) = f_\theta(\mathcal{D}_t).
\]
Training minimizes a weighted loss plus a constraint penalty:
\[
\min_{\theta} \sum_t \sum_{j=1}^{n_t} w_{j,t}\big(\sigma^{IV}_{j,t}-\widehat{\sigma}^{DL}_t(k_{j,t},\tau_{j,t})\big)^2 + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{P}(\widehat{\sigma}^{DL}_t),
\]
where \(\mathcal{P}(\cdot)\) approximates static no-arbitrage violations (implemented via discrete convexity/monotonicity checks on the implied call price surface reconstructed from IV).

### 3.3 Static arbitrage metrics
Define an “arbitrage violation score” for each day:
\[
A_t^{(m)} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{G}|}\sum_{(k,\tau)\in\mathcal{G}} \mathbb{1}(\text{violation at }(k,\tau)).
\]
I test whether deep learning reduces violations:
\[
A_t^{(DL)} - A_t^{(SVI)} < 0\quad\text{on average.}
\]

### 3.4 Forecasting IV factors
From each fitted surface, construct factor time series (ATM level, 25-delta skew, term-structure slope). Forecasting regression at horizon \(h\):
\[
F_{t+h} = \alpha_h + \beta_h F_t^{(m)} + \Gamma_h W_t + \varepsilon_{t+h},
\]
where \(W_t\) includes VIX, realized volatility, and rates. Out-of-sample RMSE and \(R^2\) compare models. The key mechanism is that better surface estimation reduces measurement error in \(F_t\), improving predictive regressions.

### 3.5 Downstream pricing and hedging evaluation
To connect the surface to economic outcomes, I will price hold-out options via Black–Scholes using \(\widehat{\sigma}_t^{(m)}\), and compute deltas from the surface. Delta-hedged P&L with transaction costs is:
\[
\Pi_{i,t+1}^{(m)} = P_{i,t+1} - P_{i,t} - \widehat{\Delta}^{(m)}_{i,t}(S_{t+1}-S_t) - c\,S_t\,|\widehat{\Delta}^{(m)}_{i,t}-\widehat{\Delta}^{(m)}_{i,t-1}|.
\]
I estimate a panel regression:
\[
\Pi_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta\,\mathbb{1}(DL\ surface) + \gamma'Z_{i,t} + \delta_{\tau}+\delta_{m}+\delta_t + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}.
\]

### 3.6 Economic application: volatility trading signal from surface forecasts
To translate improved surface estimation into economic relevance, I will construct a simple, transparent trading strategy based on predicted changes in IV factors. For example, if the model forecasts an increase in short-dated ATM IV level, a volatility buyer strategy can be implemented by buying a delta-hedged ATM straddle and holding for one day/week. Strategy P&L will be computed net of bid–ask spreads using IvyDB quotes. The key test is whether signals generated from the DL-estimated factors produce higher risk-adjusted returns than signals from SVI-based factors, consistent with reduced measurement error and better forecasts.

### 3.7 Robustness and diagnostics
I will (i) evaluate performance separately in calm versus crisis regimes (using VIX thresholds), (ii) test sensitivity to liquidity filters and quote subsampling (to mimic missing data), and (iii) compare stability metrics such as day-to-day surface roughness and parameter variance. Because the goal is a practitioner-usable surface, I will also report runtime and the frequency of failed fits for each approach.
Finally, I will verify that any improvements are not driven by overfitting by using strict time splits and by repeating the analysis with rolling-window re-training to mimic real-time deployment. I will also test whether the DL surface preserves economically plausible shapes (e.g., stronger skew during drawdowns) by correlating factor innovations with market returns.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words, must include descriptive statistics table)
**Primary data:** OptionMetrics IvyDB US (via WRDS). **Access is verified** (Tilburg University WRDS subscription confirmed). IvyDB provides end-of-day implied volatilities, bid/ask quotes, strikes, maturities, option type, volume, and open interest.

**Auxiliary sources:**
- Underlying returns and dividends: CRSP via WRDS or OptionMetrics underlying files.
- Risk-free curve: Treasury yields.
- Market volatility: VIX for regime splits; realized volatility constructed from underlying returns.

**Sample design:**
- Baseline universe: SPX options (and optionally liquid S&P 100 equity options for external validity).
- Liquidity filters: positive bids, spreads below a threshold, and minimum open interest.
- Training representation: each day becomes a set of observations \(\mathcal{D}_t\), enabling set-to-surface learning.

**Descriptive statistics (template; computed from IvyDB):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P25 | Median | P75 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Quotes per day (n_t) |  |  |  |  |  |
| ATM 30D IV (%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| 25D skew (IV points) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Term slope (90D–30D, IV pts) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Median bid–ask spread (IV pts) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Arbitrage score A_t (SVI) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Arbitrage score A_t (DL) |  |  |  |  |  |

**Feasibility:** IvyDB already contains implied vols, but I will also reconstruct call prices when needed to test arbitrage conditions. The main computational task is training the deep learning model; because the surface is on a fixed grid, evaluation and backtesting remain straightforward.
