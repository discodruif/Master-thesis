## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
American options are widely traded and economically important because early exercise changes both pricing and hedging relative to European claims. Standard numerical methods (trees, finite differences, least-squares Monte Carlo) can be computationally expensive when repeated across large cross-sections of contracts, while pure machine learning approaches may be accurate but can violate basic finance structure (monotonicity, convexity, no-arbitrage) and may extrapolate poorly.

**Research question:**

1) *Can physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that embed the Black–Scholes–Merton (or local volatility) PDE and no-arbitrage constraints produce accurate American option prices and early-exercise boundaries across a wide grid of strikes and maturities?*

2) *Do constraint-aware neural pricing models improve hedging performance (delta and gamma) relative to unconstrained deep networks and standard numerical benchmarks, especially in regions where early exercise is relevant?*

The project contributes by focusing on *structure-preserving* ML: enforcing the governing PDE/variational inequality and economic shape constraints so that learned prices are usable for risk management, not only point prediction.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (MAX 1 PAGE)
Option pricing theory derives from no-arbitrage and continuous-time replication (Black & Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1973). For American options, pricing becomes an optimal stopping problem; the price satisfies a variational inequality with a free boundary (early-exercise boundary). Numerical methods such as binomial trees, finite differences, and least-squares Monte Carlo are standard, but can be costly at scale.

Machine learning approaches to option pricing have grown rapidly, including neural network regressors and hybrid Monte Carlo methods. A key concern is that black-box models can violate financial structure. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) address this by incorporating the pricing PDE as a soft/hard constraint in training, improving data efficiency and generalization. Recent work on **physics-informed neural networks for option pricing** (e.g., Liu, Borovykh, Grzelak, & Oosterlee) demonstrates that embedding PDE constraints can yield accurate prices with less data and improved extrapolation.

For American options, deep learning has been proposed for pricing and hedging in high dimensions, including BSDE-based neural solvers and deep learning approximations of continuation values. The open research gap is a systematic evaluation of whether PINN-style constraints and no-arbitrage shape restrictions translate into *better hedging Greeks* and more stable early-exercise boundary estimation in an empirical dataset.

This thesis will connect the PINN/PDE-constraint literature with the finance requirements of arbitrage-free pricing and implementable hedging, positioning results in the language of top finance journals (*JF, JFE, RFS, JFQA, Review of Finance, Management Science*).

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words; includes regression equations)
### 3.1 Model setup
Start from a baseline diffusion (risk-neutral) for the underlying \(S_t\):
\[
\mathrm{d}S_t = (r-q) S_t \, \mathrm{d}t + \sigma(S_t,t) S_t \, \mathrm{d}W_t
\]
Under Black–Scholes, \(\sigma\) is constant; under local volatility, \(\sigma(S,t)\) can be implied from the surface.

For an American put, the price \(V(S,t;K,T)\) solves the variational inequality:
\[
\max\Big( \mathcal{L}V - rV,\; K-S - V \Big)=0
\]
with terminal condition \(V(S,T)=\max(K-S,0)\), where \(\mathcal{L}\) is the diffusion generator.

### 3.2 PINN specification
Approximate \(V\) by a neural network \(V_\theta(S,t,K,T)\). Training loss combines:
- PDE residual loss on continuation region points.
- Inequality/penalty terms enforcing \(V \ge K-S\) and smooth pasting conditions near the boundary.
- Boundary/terminal condition losses.

Additionally impose **no-arbitrage shape constraints** (for fixed \(t, T\)):
- Monotonicity in strike (put price increasing in \(K\)).
- Convexity in strike.
- Limits as \(S\to 0\) and \(S\to \infty\).

### 3.3 Benchmarks
- Cox–Ross–Rubinstein binomial tree.
- Longstaff–Schwartz LSM (if using simulated paths).
- Unconstrained deep network regression trained on benchmark prices.

### 3.4 Hedging evaluation and regressions
Compute implied deltas \(\Delta_{\theta}=\partial V_\theta/\partial S\) and compare hedging performance.

Define daily hedging error for contract i:
\[
HE_{i,t+1} = (V_{i,t+1}-V_{i,t}) - \Delta_{i,t} (S_{t+1}-S_t) - TC_{i,t}
\]
where \(\Delta_{i,t}\) is obtained from each model.

Test whether PINN deltas reduce hedging error vs benchmarks:
\[
|HE_{i,t+1}| = \alpha + \beta_1 \mathbb{1}[\text{PINN}] + \beta_2 \mathbb{1}[\text{UnconstrainedNN}] + \Gamma' X_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}
\]
with controls \(X\) including moneyness, maturity, and liquidity.

Early exercise boundary estimation: recover \(S^*(t)\) such that \(V(S^*,t)=K-S^*\). Evaluate stability and compare to benchmark boundaries across regimes.

### 3.5 Robustness
- Different underlyings and dividend yields.
- Local volatility vs constant volatility assumptions.
- Stress regimes (high realized volatility).

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words; includes descriptive statistics table)
**Primary dataset (verified access):** OptionMetrics IvyDB US via WRDS (Tilburg University access verified). IvyDB provides American-style equity option quotes for many underlyings and associated implied volatilities.

**Data strategy:**
- Use American equity options (where early exercise is relevant) and focus on contracts with sufficient liquidity.
- Construct inputs \((S_t, r_t, q_t, K, T)\) from IvyDB fields (risk-free rates and dividend yields as available or approximated).
- Because IvyDB implied vol is often reported under European assumptions, I will treat observed prices as the primary object and use implied vol only as a control/feature.

**Training labels:**
- Generate benchmark American prices using a tree/finite-difference method calibrated to implied vol (or local vol) on each date, producing a training set with known “ground truth” for the network.
- Alternatively, use observed market prices directly and treat the PDE constraint as regularization.

**Descriptive statistics table (to be completed):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P5 | P50 | P95 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Put moneyness (K/S) |  |  |  |  |  | American equity puts |
| Time-to-maturity (days) |  |  |  |  |  | 7–180 |
| Bid–ask spread (relative) |  |  |  |  |  | liquidity |
| Early exercise premium (est.) |  |  |  |  |  | price − European |
| Hedging error |  |  |  |  |  | per day |

The thesis will explicitly state that the data access is verified (WRDS IvyDB US) and will document sample filters and reproducibility.

### Additional implementation notes (calibration, numerical baselines, and feasibility)
**Calibration to market inputs.** A practical issue is choosing \(\sigma\) and dividend yield \(q\). I will evaluate two settings: (i) constant \(\sigma\) estimated from short-maturity ATM implied vol each day, and (ii) a local-volatility approximation inferred from the implied volatility surface (when available) to generate benchmark prices. The goal is not to claim a perfect structural model, but to test whether the PINN approach can learn an internally consistent price function that generalizes across strikes/maturities.

**Numerical benchmark generation.** For each date and underlying, I will generate benchmark American option prices on a grid using a Cox–Ross–Rubinstein tree or finite-difference method. This yields a dense, noise-free training dataset (price labels) and also provides a comparison standard. The neural model is then evaluated on held-out strikes/maturities and on subsequent dates.

**Free-boundary evaluation.** Because American pricing is characterized by an exercise boundary, I will include diagnostics that are not captured by RMSE alone: smoothness of the estimated boundary \(S^*(t)\), monotonicity of \(S^*(t)\) over time, and whether the estimated boundary behaves sensibly across regimes (e.g., boundary moves as rates/dividends change).

**Economic evaluation with transaction costs.** Hedging tests will incorporate realistic rebalancing costs computed from underlying bid–ask proxies (and, when feasible, from option spreads if vega hedges are added). I will report both gross hedging error reductions and net improvements after costs.

**Feasibility.** The project is computationally feasible because it operates on daily grids and can be implemented with moderate neural architectures. The main challenge is careful numerical benchmark construction and stable training of the PINN loss; to manage this, I will start with a narrow scope (single underlying, single option type) and expand only after validating each component.

### Additional empirical tests
To test whether boundary estimation errors are systematic, I will compute a daily boundary-distance metric \(BD_{t}=\int |\widehat{S}^*(t)-S^*_{bench}(t)|\,dt\) (approximated on a grid) and regress it on market conditions:
\[
BD_t = \alpha + \rho_1 \text{VIX}_t + \rho_2 \text{Rates}_t + \rho_3 \text{DividendYield}_t + e_t
\]
If PINN boundaries are more stable, \(BD_t\) should be lower and less sensitive to stressed regimes.

**Planned outputs:** (1) pricing accuracy plots by moneyness/maturity, (2) arbitrage diagnostics (monotonicity/convexity checks), (3) early-exercise boundary curves over time, and (4) hedging-error distributions comparing PINN Greeks vs benchmark Greeks. These will make the contribution concrete to a finance audience.
A key deliverable will be a reproducible pipeline that takes a daily IvyDB option panel, fits benchmark American prices on a grid, trains the constrained neural model, and reports both statistical and hedging-based performance measures.
The thesis will emphasize constraints and hedging relevance, which are central to publishable finance research and to practical derivative risk management.
It will also compare robustness across calm and crisis subsamples.
