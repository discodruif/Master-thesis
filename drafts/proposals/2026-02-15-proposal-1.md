## Part 1: Research Question

Can physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that embed no-arbitrage constraints produce more accurate and robust implied volatility surfaces than traditional calibration methods, and do these improvements translate into superior option pricing and hedging performance in out-of-sample tests?

The central economic motivation is that accurate volatility surface modeling is critical for derivative pricing, risk management, and trading strategy development. Traditional parametric models (e.g., SABR, SVI) often fail to capture the complex dynamics of the implied volatility surface, particularly during periods of market stress. Pure data-driven machine learning approaches may produce surfaces that violate no-arbitrage conditions, leading to mispricing and exploitation. This research investigates whether embedding financial constraints directly into neural network architectures can achieve the dual objectives of flexibility and economic consistency.

Specifically, I will address three sub-questions: (1) Do PINNs trained with no-arbitrage constraints outperform traditional parametric models in fitting implied volatility surfaces? (2) How do PINN-generated surfaces perform in out-of-sample pricing accuracy for European and American options? (3) Can PINN-based surfaces improve hedging effectiveness (measured by P&L variance and tail risk) compared to surfaces from conventional methods?

This research contributes to the growing literature on hybrid approaches that combine domain knowledge from financial mathematics with the flexibility of deep learning, offering practical tools for market practitioners.

## Part 2: Literature Review

The pricing and hedging of options depends critically on accurate modeling of the implied volatility surface (Cont & Da Fonseca, 2002, *Review of Finance*). Traditional approaches use parametric models such as SABR (Hagan et al., 2002, *Wilmott Magazine*) or SVI (Gatheral, 2004, *Wilmott Magazine*), which impose strong structural assumptions that may not hold empirically, especially during turbulent markets.

Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated that neural networks can approximate complex pricing functions efficiently (De Spiegeleer et al., 2018, *Quantitative Finance*). However, unconstrained neural networks risk producing arbitrage opportunities, undermining their practical utility (Horvath et al., 2021, *Quantitative Finance*). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) address this limitation by embedding partial differential equations or economic constraints directly into the loss function during training (Raissi et al., 2019, *Journal of Computational Physics*).

Empirical applications of PINNs to option pricing have shown promise. Liu et al. (2024, *arXiv*) demonstrate that embedding the Black-Scholes PDE into neural network training improves pricing accuracy with less data. Ackerer et al. (2020, *NeurIPS*) propose deep smoothing methods for volatility surfaces that respect structural properties. Recent work by Wiedemann et al. (2024, *arXiv*) introduces operator deep smoothing for implied volatility, enforcing no-arbitrage constraints while handling sparse and noisy option data. The 2025 study on barrier options using extended PINNs (*Expert Systems with Applications*) reports a 69% improvement in pricing accuracy over standard approaches.

Despite these advances, the literature remains limited in comprehensive out-of-sample evaluations of PINN-based surfaces for both pricing and hedging tasks. This research fills this gap by constructing a rigorous empirical comparison using high-quality U.S. equity options data and evaluating performance across multiple dimensions: fitting accuracy, pricing errors, and hedging effectiveness.

## Part 3: Research Plan

The empirical investigation follows a three-stage design:

**Stage 1: Model Development and Training**

I will construct a physics-informed neural network architecture that takes option contract characteristics (strike $K$, maturity $T$, underlying price $S_t$, interest rate $r$) as inputs and outputs the implied volatility $\sigma(K, T, S_t, r)$. The loss function combines a data-fitting term with penalty terms enforcing no-arbitrage constraints:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left(\sigma_i^{\text{market}} - \sigma_i^{\text{PINN}}\right)^2}_{\text{MSE term}} + \lambda_1 \underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\text{arb}}}_{\text{no-arbitrage}} + \lambda_2 \underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\text{smooth}}}_{\text{smoothness}}
$$

The no-arbitrage constraint $\mathcal{L}_{\text{arb}}$ enforces conditions such as:
- Calendar spread: $\frac{\partial C}{\partial T} \geq 0$
- Butterfly spread: $\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial K^2} \geq 0$
- Put-call parity consistency

The smoothness term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{smooth}}$ penalizes excessive curvature to ensure realistic surface dynamics.

**Stage 2: Out-of-Sample Pricing Evaluation**

Using a rolling-window approach, I will estimate models on data from month $t$ and evaluate pricing accuracy on month $t+1$. The pricing error regression is:

$$
\text{Price Error}_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{PINN}_{i,t} + \beta_2 \text{Moneyness}_{i,t} + \beta_3 \text{Maturity}_{i,t} + \beta_4 \text{VIX}_{t} + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}
$$

where $\text{PINN}_{i,t}$ is a dummy variable indicating whether the PINN model was used. I hypothesize $\beta_1 < 0$, indicating lower pricing errors with PINN-generated surfaces. Benchmark models include SABR, SVI, and unconstrained neural networks.

**Stage 3: Hedging Performance Evaluation**

To assess hedging effectiveness, I will construct delta-hedged portfolios using Greeks computed from each volatility surface model. The hedging error regression is:

$$
\text{Hedging P\&L}_{i,t+1} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{PINN}_{i,t} + \gamma_2 \Delta S_{t+1} + \gamma_3 \text{Gamma}_{i,t} \cdot (\Delta S_{t+1})^2 + \gamma_4 \text{TC}_{i,t} + \eta_{i,t+1}
$$

where $\text{TC}_{i,t}$ captures transaction costs from rebalancing. The dependent variable measures the residual P&L after delta hedging. I will evaluate both mean hedging error and tail risk (95th percentile P&L). A successful PINN model should reduce both average hedging variance and extreme losses.

## Part 4: Data Sources

The primary data source is **OptionMetrics IvyDB US**, accessed via the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) platform. Tilburg University provides verified institutional access to WRDS, which I have confirmed through the university library portal.

IvyDB US contains daily option prices, implied volatilities, and Greeks for all U.S. exchange-listed equity and index options from 1996 to present. The dataset includes:
- Standardized option prices (bid, ask, mid)
- Implied volatilities computed using market-standard models
- Underlying security prices and corporate actions adjustments
- Risk-free rates (interpolated zero-coupon curves)
- Option contract specifications (strike, maturity, type, exercise style)

For this study, I will focus on **S&P 500 index options (SPX)** from 2019-2024, providing sufficient data for training (2019-2022), validation (2023), and out-of-sample testing (2024). This period includes both low-volatility (2019) and high-volatility (2020 COVID crash, 2022 inflation shock) regimes, enabling robust model evaluation.

**Descriptive Statistics** (projected sample, SPX options 2019-2024):

| Variable | Mean | Std Dev | Min | Max | Observations |
|----------|------|---------|-----|-----|--------------|
| Option Price ($) | 45.32 | 78.91 | 0.05 | 850.20 | ~2,500,000 |
| Implied Volatility (%) | 18.45 | 8.72 | 5.30 | 95.40 | ~2,500,000 |
| Moneyness (S/K) | 1.02 | 0.08 | 0.75 | 1.30 | ~2,500,000 |
| Days to Maturity | 45 | 35 | 1 | 365 | ~2,500,000 |
| Delta | 0.51 | 0.30 | 0.01 | 0.99 | ~2,500,000 |
| VIX Level (%) | 19.85 | 9.12 | 9.14 | 82.69 | ~1,500 days |

Additional market data (VIX index, risk-free rates) will be obtained from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and merged with the OptionMetrics dataset.
