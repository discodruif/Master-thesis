## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
Options are among the most information‑sensitive securities: their prices reflect expectations about volatility, tail risk, and risk premia. Yet option markets can exhibit predictability in returns, especially when one uses richer information sets and nonlinear interactions. Recent research in the *Review of Financial Studies* shows that machine learning with big data can forecast option returns and extract economically meaningful signals.

**RQ:** *Can machine learning models trained on OptionMetrics IvyDB option panels predict cross‑sectional option returns and generate trading strategies that deliver positive risk‑adjusted performance after realistic transaction costs?*  

To ensure the thesis is economically tight rather than a “black box forecast,” I will study *which* features drive predictability (IV level, skew, term structure, realized volatility, underlying momentum, liquidity), and *where* predictability is strongest (moneyness/maturity buckets; volatility regimes). The output is a set of transparent, implementable strategies: long/short option portfolios formed on predicted returns (or predicted mispricing relative to a benchmark surface). This is economically important because many option strategies look attractive gross of costs, but may collapse once spreads and turnover are included. A careful, WRDS‑replicable strategy evaluation using IvyDB data (access verified) directly speaks to whether ML signals can be monetized in the options market.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (MAX 1 page)
The classical option pricing framework (Black & Scholes, 1973) implies that, in frictionless markets, option prices are fully determined by the underlying dynamics and risk‑free rate. Empirically, however, implied volatility surfaces vary strongly across strike and maturity (the “smile/skew”), consistent with stochastic volatility and jump risk premia. In practice, IV surface state variables are interpreted as proxies for risk premia, and their dynamics are linked to option returns.

A key economic lens is *limits to arbitrage*: even if mispricing exists, it may persist due to transaction costs, margin requirements, inventory risk, and model uncertainty. Options amplify these frictions because spreads are large for some strikes/maturities and because returns are highly nonlinear. Therefore, a credible trading thesis must explicitly model the trading universe (liquidity filters), turnover, and cost sensitivity, and report performance in stressed periods.

A recent, directly relevant reference is Bali, Beckmeyer, Moerke, and Weigert (2023, *Review of Financial Studies*), who show that **machine learning and big data** can predict option returns and extract economically meaningful cross‑sectional patterns. Their core message is aligned with the modern predictive asset pricing literature in top journals (JF/JFE/RFS/JFQA): nonlinear ML can handle large feature sets and interactions, but must be evaluated out‑of‑sample with rigorous economic value metrics.

This thesis builds on that evidence and contributes in three ways. First, I implement a WRDS‑replicable IvyDB pipeline and document the effect of **transaction costs** in realistic option portfolios (high turnover is the central challenge). Second, I focus on **model interpretability** (e.g., SHAP, feature importance, monotonic constraints where possible) to translate ML results into financial intuition about risk premia. Third, I connect prediction to trading by explicitly modeling constraints: trade only liquid contracts, control leverage, and report performance under multiple cost assumptions.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words; include regression equations)
### 3.1 Unit of analysis and returns
For each option i at date t, I will compute subsequent holding‑period returns over horizon h (e.g., 1 week):
\[
R^{opt}_{i,t\to t+h} = \frac{P_{i,t+h} - P_{i,t}}{P_{i,t}}
\]
using mid prices (and robustness using conservative execution prices). I will construct feature vectors \(X_{i,t}\) including option characteristics and market state.

### 3.2 ML prediction models
Baseline models will include:
- Linear/Lasso benchmark
- Tree‑based models (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting)
- Neural network benchmark

The goal is not to maximize complexity, but to provide a credible comparison to linear factor models and to the evidence in RFS.

### 3.3 Portfolio formation and economic evaluation
Each day/week, sort options into predicted‑return deciles using \(\widehat{R}^{opt}_{i,t}\). Build a long–short portfolio:
\[
LS_t = \frac{1}{N_L}\sum_{i\in L} R^{opt}_{i,t\to t+h} - \frac{1}{N_S}\sum_{i\in S} R^{opt}_{i,t\to t+h}
\]
with constraints on moneyness/maturity and liquidity. Compute turnover and apply transaction costs.

Transaction costs will be modeled using bid‑ask spreads (half‑spread baseline, full spread robustness):
\[
R^{net}_{p,t} = R^{gross}_{p,t} - \kappa \cdot \text{Turnover}_{p,t}
\]
where \(\kappa\) is derived from observed spreads and contract notionals. I will also compute a *break‑even spread* metric: the average spread level at which the strategy’s net Sharpe becomes zero, which provides an intuitive “implementability” measure.

**Risk controls and portfolio constraints.** Because option returns have strong exposure to underlying moves and volatility shocks, I will also evaluate constrained variants:
- **Delta‑neutral long–short:** hedge underlying exposure using index futures/ETF so that portfolio delta is close to zero.
- **Vega‑managed:** restrict net vega or focus on near‑ATM options to limit extreme tail exposure.
- **Holding period vs turnover:** compare 1‑day vs 5‑day vs 20‑day horizons to quantify the turnover–alpha trade‑off.

These constraints make the strategies closer to what a volatility or derivatives desk could implement.

### 3.4 Regression equations (prediction + pricing tests)
**(A) Predictive regression benchmark:**
\[
R^{opt}_{i,t\to t+h} = \alpha + \beta' Z_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\]
where \(Z\) includes conventional predictors (IV level, skew, term structure, realized volatility, underlying momentum, liquidity).

**(B) ML signal “spanning” test:** after producing ML score \(s_{i,t}\) (e.g., predicted return), test incremental information:
\[
R^{opt}_{i,t\to t+h} = \alpha + \phi s_{i,t} + \beta' Z_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\]
The coefficient \(\phi\) measures whether ML contains information beyond standard predictors.

**(C) Mispricing relative to a benchmark surface:** define a “model‑implied” price \(\widetilde{P}_{i,t}\) from an arbitrage‑free IV surface (or parametric SVI). Define mispricing \(M_{i,t} = (P_{i,t}-\widetilde{P}_{i,t})/P_{i,t}\) and test whether mispricing predicts returns:
\[
R^{opt}_{i,t\to t+h} = \alpha + \psi M_{i,t} + \eta' W_{i,t} + u_{i,t}
\]
This links ML trading to a pricing‑economics interpretation.

### 3.5 Risk adjustment and robustness
- **Regimes:** subsample by VIX regimes (low vs high volatility) and by market trend (up vs down markets).
- **Liquidity:** restrict to liquid options (volume/open interest thresholds), enforce minimum price, and compare near‑ATM vs out‑of‑the‑money baskets.
- **Conservative execution:** compute returns using buy at ask / sell at bid (worst‑case) to bound performance.
- **Model stability:** test whether prediction performance decays when retraining frequency is reduced (monthly vs weekly) and whether signals are robust to feature winsorization.

**Factor-style performance attribution.** To report “top‑journal style” evidence, I will estimate time‑series regressions of portfolio returns on standard equity factors and volatility controls:
\[
R^{net}_{LS,t} = \alpha + b\,\text{MKT}_t + c\,\Delta\text{VIX}_t + d\,\text{Mom}_t + e\,\text{HML}_t + f\,\text{SMB}_t + \varepsilon_t
\]
The intercept \(\alpha\) provides a risk‑adjusted measure of whether the ML strategy delivers abnormal performance. I will also report drawdowns and tail metrics (e.g., skewness, kurtosis, and CVaR of portfolio returns).

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words; include descriptive statistics table; confirm access)
**Primary data:** **OptionMetrics IvyDB US via WRDS (access verified).** I will use daily option quotes for SPX (and potentially SPY) including bid/ask/mid prices, implied volatilities, volume, open interest, and contract characteristics.

**Supplementary data:** underlying returns (CRSP), risk‑free rates, and market volatility indices (VIX). These are standard WRDS datasets and will allow consistent computation of forward prices, moneyness, and realized volatility features.

**Feature set (examples):**
- Option: \(\ln(K/F)\), time to maturity, implied vol, delta, gamma, vega (if available), bid‑ask spread, open interest.
- IV surface: ATM IV level, skew, term structure slope, IV changes.
- Underlying: past returns (momentum/reversal), realized volatility, jump proxies.

**Sample design and filters.** I will begin with a broad sample (multiple years; subject to WRDS download limits) and then impose standard filters to create a tradable universe: remove options with zero bids, extremely short time to maturity, or very deep OTM strikes with unreliable quotes; require minimum volume/open interest; and winsorize extreme returns. The thesis will document how these filters affect both predictability and transaction costs, because the key economic question is whether alpha survives once the universe is realistically tradable.

**Descriptive statistics (template)**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P5 | P50 | P95 | N |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Option return (horizon h) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Implied volatility |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| IV skew measure |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Bid-ask spread |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Volume |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Open interest |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Log-moneyness |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Time-to-maturity (days) |  |  |  |  |  |  |

I will present this table for the overall sample and for the trading universe after liquidity filters, and by regime.
