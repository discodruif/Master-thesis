## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)

Options are among the most information-sensitive securities traded: their prices encode expectations about volatility, tail risk, and risk premia. Yet academic research documents predictable patterns in the cross-section of option returns tied to characteristics such as implied-volatility level, skew, and underlying momentum. A central question is whether machine learning, which can exploit nonlinear interactions among many predictors simultaneously, can capture these patterns and translate them into economically meaningful trading profits — especially once realistic frictions are accounted for.

**Research Question:** *Can machine learning models trained on OptionMetrics IvyDB option panels predict cross-sectional option returns out-of-sample and generate long-short trading strategies that deliver positive risk-adjusted performance after realistic transaction costs?*

This question is important for three reasons. First, option markets are characterized by wide bid-ask spreads and high turnover, so many strategies that look profitable gross of costs collapse once frictions are included — making a cost-aware evaluation essential. Second, ML-based option return prediction is a recent development in top finance journals (Bali et al., 2023, *RFS*), and replication with transparent methodology is valuable. Third, I will go beyond black-box prediction by studying *which* features drive predictability, *where* it is strongest (by moneyness, maturity, and volatility regime), and *how* it relates to risk premia versus mispricing — connecting ML to economic mechanisms.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (MAX 1 page)

### Classical pricing and the volatility surface
The Black-Scholes (1973) model provides the foundational framework for option pricing under the assumption of constant volatility and frictionless markets. Empirically, implied volatility varies strongly across strike and maturity — the "smile" and "skew" — reflecting stochastic volatility, jump risk premia, and market microstructure effects (Heston, 1993; Bakshi, Cao, & Chen, 1997). These deviations from Black-Scholes create the possibility that cross-sectional option characteristics carry information about expected returns.

### Option return predictability
The literature on cross-sectional option return predictability is newer and growing rapidly. Goyal and Saretto (2009, *JFE*) show that the deviation of implied from historical volatility predicts delta-hedged option returns, consistent with limits to arbitrage preventing full price correction. Cao and Han (2013, *JF*) document a negative relationship between idiosyncratic volatility and delta-hedged option returns, linking option mispricing to hedging demand and inventory constraints. Most directly, **Bali, Beckmeyer, Moerke, and Weigert (2023, *RFS*)** demonstrate that machine learning with a large set of option and underlying characteristics can predict the cross-section of option returns, generating economically significant long-short profits. Their study is the central anchor for this thesis.

### Machine learning in empirical asset pricing
In equities, **Gu, Kelly, and Xiu (2020, *RFS*)** establish that nonlinear ML methods (neural networks, tree ensembles) substantially outperform linear models in predicting cross-sectional stock returns, provided evaluation is genuinely out-of-sample with rolling time splits. Their framework — which emphasizes economic interpretation via feature importance — is directly transferable to option markets where the feature space is richer (Greeks, IV surface shape, term structure).

### Limits to arbitrage and transaction costs
Option markets amplify limits-to-arbitrage frictions: bid-ask spreads can be 5-15% of mid-price for out-of-the-money contracts, margin requirements are substantial, and inventory risk is acute during volatility spikes (Muravyev, 2016). De Fontnouvelle, Fishe, and Harris (2003) document that option transaction costs are economically large and vary systematically across moneyness and maturity. Any credible trading thesis must therefore model costs explicitly and report break-even cost levels.

### Contribution of this thesis
This thesis contributes by (i) replicating and extending the ML option return prediction of Bali et al. (2023) using a transparent, WRDS-replicable IvyDB pipeline; (ii) evaluating long-short strategies under multiple realistic transaction cost scenarios including proportional spreads, slippage estimates, and conservative execution assumptions; and (iii) using model interpretability tools (SHAP values, feature importance) to connect ML signals to economic drivers such as volatility risk premia, limits to arbitrage, and liquidity.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words)

### 3.1 Unit of analysis and option return definition

For each option contract *i* observed at date *t*, I compute the holding-period return over horizon *h* (baseline: one week):

> **R_opt(i, t to t+h) = [ P(i, t+h) - P(i, t) ] / P(i, t)**

using mid prices (average of bid and ask). As robustness, I also compute **delta-hedged returns** to isolate the component not explained by directional underlying moves:

> **R_dh(i, t to t+h) = R_opt(i, t to t+h) - Delta(i,t) * R_underlying(t to t+h)**

where Delta(i,t) is the OptionMetrics-provided delta. The feature vector X(i,t) includes option characteristics (implied volatility, moneyness ln(K/F), time to maturity, Greeks, bid-ask spread, volume, open interest), IV surface features (ATM level, skew, term structure slope), and underlying characteristics (past returns, realized volatility, VIX level).

### 3.2 ML prediction models and training protocol

I estimate three model classes, plus a linear benchmark:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **OLS / Lasso** | Linear benchmark; quantifies gains from nonlinearity |
| **Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost)** | Captures interactions and nonlinearities; strong empirical track record |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble benchmark; lower variance than single trees |
| **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** | Neural network benchmark; flexible function approximator |

**Training protocol (rolling time split).** To prevent look-ahead bias, I use expanding or rolling windows: train on T months (e.g., 36 months), validate on the next 3 months for hyperparameter selection, and test on the subsequent month. This produces a sequence of genuine out-of-sample predictions. Hyperparameters are tuned via randomized search on the validation set, with early stopping for boosting/neural nets.

### 3.3 Portfolio formation and economic evaluation

Each rebalancing date, I sort options into predicted-return deciles using the out-of-sample predictions R-hat(i,t). I construct a long-short portfolio:

> **R_LS(t) = (1/N_L) * SUM[i in Top decile] R(i, t to t+h) - (1/N_S) * SUM[i in Bottom decile] R(i, t to t+h)**

with constraints: options must meet minimum volume (>= 50 contracts/day), minimum open interest (>= 500), positive bid, and moneyness within [0.80, 1.20].

**Transaction cost model.** Costs are modeled at three levels of conservatism:

| Scenario | Cost assumption |
|---|---|
| **Baseline** | Half bid-ask spread on entry and exit |
| **Conservative** | Full bid-ask spread on entry and exit |
| **Worst-case** | Full spread + 10% slippage markup |

Net returns:

> **R_net(p, t) = R_gross(p, t) - kappa(t) * Turnover(p, t)**

where kappa(t) is the portfolio-weighted average transaction cost at time t. I also compute the **break-even spread**: the average cost level at which the strategy's net Sharpe ratio equals zero — providing an intuitive implementability metric.

### 3.4 Regression equations

**(A) Predictive regression benchmark:**

> **R_opt(i, t to t+h) = alpha + beta' * Z(i,t) + epsilon(i,t)**

where Z includes conventional predictors (IV level, skew, realized vol, momentum, liquidity).

**(B) ML signal spanning test — does ML add information beyond standard predictors?**

> **R_opt(i, t to t+h) = alpha + phi * s(i,t) + beta' * Z(i,t) + epsilon(i,t)**

where s(i,t) is the ML predicted return. A significant phi indicates incremental predictive content.

**(C) Mispricing vs. risk premium decomposition:**

> **R_dh(i, t to t+h) = alpha + psi * M(i,t) + eta' * W(i,t) + u(i,t)**

where M(i,t) = [P(i,t) - P-tilde(i,t)] / P(i,t) is mispricing relative to a benchmark IV surface (SVI parametrization), and W(i,t) includes controls for gamma, vega, and theta exposure. Using delta-hedged returns as the dependent variable isolates returns beyond directional risk; controlling for higher-order Greeks addresses whether the signal reflects compensation for non-directional risk or genuine mispricing.

### 3.5 Risk adjustment and performance attribution

I estimate factor regressions on net portfolio returns:

> **R_net_LS(t) = alpha + b * MKT(t) + c * dVIX(t) + d * Mom(t) + e * HML(t) + f * SMB(t) + epsilon(t)**

The intercept alpha provides the risk-adjusted abnormal return. I report Sharpe ratios, maximum drawdown, skewness, kurtosis, and CVaR (5%) for all portfolios.

### 3.6 Robustness and subsample analysis

- **VIX regimes:** split sample at median VIX; test whether predictability concentrates in high-volatility periods (consistent with limits-to-arbitrage).
- **Moneyness/maturity buckets:** evaluate separately for ATM (|M| < 0.03), OTM puts, and OTM calls; near-term (< 30 days) vs. medium-term (30-90 days).
- **Holding period variation:** compare 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day horizons to quantify the turnover-alpha trade-off.
- **Conservative execution:** compute returns using buy-at-ask / sell-at-bid to bound implementable performance.
- **Model stability:** test whether prediction accuracy degrades when retraining frequency drops from monthly to quarterly.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words)

### 4.1 Primary data
**OptionMetrics IvyDB US via WRDS (access verified).** I use daily end-of-day option quotes for S&P 500 index options (SPX) from **January 2010 to December 2024** (15 years). This long sample captures multiple volatility regimes including the European debt crisis (2011-2012), the low-vol environment (2013-2019), the COVID crash (March 2020), and the post-COVID rate-hiking cycle (2022-2024).

Variables extracted: option bid, ask, and mid price; strike (K); expiration date and time to maturity (tau); implied volatility (sigma_IV); Greeks (delta, gamma, vega); volume; open interest; and contract identifiers.

### 4.2 Supplementary data
- **Underlying returns:** SPX index levels from OptionMetrics or CRSP.
- **Risk-free rate:** Treasury curve from WRDS, consistent with OptionMetrics conventions.
- **VIX:** CBOE VIX index for regime classification.
- **Equity factors:** Fama-French factors (MKT, SMB, HML, Mom) from Kenneth French's data library via WRDS.
- **Realized volatility:** computed from intraday or daily underlying returns.

### 4.3 Sample filters
Standard filters following Bali et al. (2023): remove options with zero bid, time to maturity < 7 days or > 365 days, moneyness outside [0.80, 1.20], and duplicate/erroneous quotes. Require minimum daily volume >= 10 and open interest >= 100 for the broad sample; apply stricter filters (volume >= 50, OI >= 500) for the "tradable universe" subsample.

### 4.4 Descriptive statistics (expected ranges based on SPX options literature)

| Variable | Mean | Std | P5 | P50 | P95 | N (approx.) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Option return (weekly, %) | -1.2 | 28.5 | -45.0 | -3.8 | 42.0 | ~3,000,000 |
| Delta-hedged return (weekly, %) | -0.8 | 12.4 | -22.0 | -1.0 | 16.5 | ~3,000,000 |
| Implied volatility | 0.19 | 0.09 | 0.10 | 0.17 | 0.38 | ~3,000,000 |
| IV skew (25D put - ATM) | 0.045 | 0.025 | 0.015 | 0.040 | 0.095 | ~3,000,000 |
| Bid-ask spread ($) | 1.85 | 3.20 | 0.10 | 0.80 | 7.50 | ~3,000,000 |
| Bid-ask spread (% of mid) | 8.5 | 12.3 | 0.5 | 4.2 | 32.0 | ~3,000,000 |
| Volume (contracts/day) | 285 | 2,100 | 2 | 35 | 850 | ~3,000,000 |
| Open interest | 4,200 | 12,500 | 50 | 1,200 | 18,000 | ~3,000,000 |
| Log-moneyness ln(K/F) | -0.02 | 0.10 | -0.20 | -0.01 | 0.15 | ~3,000,000 |
| Time to maturity (days) | 62 | 68 | 8 | 35 | 180 | ~3,000,000 |

*Note: These are expected ranges based on the SPX options literature. Final values will be computed from the actual sample after applying filters.*

I will present this table for (i) the full sample, (ii) the tradable universe after strict liquidity filters, and (iii) by VIX regime (low vs. high).

## Feasibility & Timeline

| Period | Activity |
|---|---|
| **Month 1** (Mar 2026) | Data extraction & cleaning: download IvyDB SPX panel, apply filters, construct features, compute option returns. Replicate basic descriptive statistics. |
| **Month 2** (Apr 2026) | ML model training: implement rolling-window pipeline for OLS/Lasso, XGBoost, Random Forest, MLP. Validate out-of-sample predictions. |
| **Month 3** (May 2026) | Portfolio construction & cost analysis: build decile long-short portfolios, compute net returns under three cost scenarios, estimate factor regressions. |
| **Month 4** (Jun 2026) | Robustness & interpretation: subsample analysis (VIX regimes, moneyness buckets), SHAP feature importance, mispricing decomposition regressions. |
| **Month 5** (Jul 2026) | Writing & revision: finalize thesis document, tables, and figures. Buffer for addressing supervisor feedback. |

**Key risk:** If SPX option data volume exceeds WRDS download limits, I will restrict to a shorter sample (2015-2024) or reduce the feature set. The rolling-window design is computationally manageable on a standard laptop for the models selected.
