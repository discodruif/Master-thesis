## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
Option markets are often viewed as highly efficient because of competition among sophisticated traders and market makers. Yet a growing literature documents economically meaningful predictability in option returns and in option-implied measures of risk, especially when signals are constructed from rich cross-sectional information and nonlinear interactions. Machine learning can combine many weak predictors into tradable signals, but the key finance question is whether such signals represent genuine mispricing (risk-adjusted abnormal returns) and whether they survive realistic trading frictions.

**Research question:**

1) *Can supervised ML models predict next-day to next-week option returns (or relative value measures) in U.S. options, and do the resulting long–short portfolios earn statistically and economically significant returns after transaction costs?*

2) *Which components drive performance: cross-sectional “mispricing” features (implied-vol deviations from an arbitrage-free surface), option characteristics (moneyness, maturity), or underlying risk factors (momentum, volatility, jump risk)?*

The project is economically important for volatility and relative-value strategies. It also clarifies whether ML performance comes from capturing priced risks or from exploiting temporary dislocations. The analysis will use verified OptionMetrics IvyDB US data via WRDS and will report both return performance and risk exposures.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (MAX 1 PAGE)
Canonical no-arbitrage theory (Black & Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1973) implies that option prices should be internally consistent across strikes and maturities and linked to the underlying’s risk-neutral distribution. Empirically, option returns reflect compensation for variance and tail risks (Carr & Wu, 2009) and for skewness/jump risks. Hence, raw option return predictability can reflect time-varying risk premia rather than mispricing.

Recent evidence suggests that ML can uncover nonlinear predictability in derivatives markets. **Huang, Wang, and Xiao (2025, Journal of Futures Markets)** provide new evidence of option return predictability using ML-based multifactor strategies (in another market), motivating a careful U.S. replication with high-quality data and cost controls. In equity markets, the broader ML asset pricing literature emphasizes high-dimensional predictors and the importance of out-of-sample evaluation and transaction costs.

A complementary stream focuses on surface consistency: predicted or interpolated surfaces can violate no-arbitrage, creating artificial “mispricing” measures. Work on arbitrage-free surface construction and repair (e.g., Zhang, Li, & Zhang, 2021; Ning et al., 2021; and nonparametric arbitrage-free surfaces such as SANOS) highlights that enforcing no-arbitrage is essential before interpreting deviations as opportunities.

This thesis positions itself at the intersection: create arbitrage-consistent measures of relative value (e.g., contract-level deviations from an arbitrage-free reference surface), use supervised ML to predict returns, and evaluate whether long–short portfolios deliver net-of-cost abnormal performance after controlling for risk factors and exposures.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words; includes regression equations)
### 3.1 Outcome variables
Primary targets:
- Next-day option returns \(R^{opt}_{i,t+1}\) (midquote-based and bid–ask execution versions).
- Alternative: relative-value return vs matched contract (e.g., delta-matched, maturity bucket) to reduce risk-premium confounding.

### 3.2 Features and “mispricing” measures
Features include:
- Contract characteristics: delta, vega, gamma, moneyness \(k\), maturity \(\tau\), open interest, volume.
- Surface features: implied vol level/skew/curvature; deviation from arbitrage-free fitted surface \(\widehat{IV}^{AF}_{t}(k,\tau)\):
\[
DevIV_{i,t} = IV_{i,t} - \widehat{IV}^{AF}_{t}(k_i,\tau_i)
\]
- Underlying controls: realized volatility, returns, market factors, VIX.

### 3.3 ML models and training
Models: elastic net / gradient boosted trees (XGBoost-style) / transformer-style tabular attention model.

Training and evaluation: rolling windows; strict out-of-sample; hyperparameters chosen on a validation window.

### 3.4 Portfolio construction and performance
Each day, rank options by predicted return \(\widehat{R}^{opt}_{i,t+1}\) (or predicted alpha after risk adjustment) within liquidity/maturity buckets to reduce microstructure bias. Construct a dollar-neutral long–short portfolio (top decile long, bottom decile short). Compute:
- Gross and net returns (with bid–ask + slippage assumptions).
- Turnover, capacity proxies (volume/open interest), and drawdowns.

### 3.5 Regression tests (risk adjustment)
First, predictive regression (Fama–MacBeth style):
\[
R^{opt}_{i,t+1} = \alpha_t + \beta' X_{i,t} + \gamma \widehat{R}^{ML}_{i,t+1} + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}
\]
where \(X\) includes standard characteristics and risk proxies.

Second, time-series regression of portfolio returns on risk factors (e.g., market, variance risk premium proxies):
\[
R^{LS}_{t+1} = a + b_1 R^{mkt}_{t+1} + b_2 \Delta VIX_{t+1} + b_3 \text{RV}_{t+1} + u_{t+1}
\]
The intercept \(a\) estimates abnormal performance.

Third, test whether “mispricing” deviations drive returns beyond risks:
\[
R^{opt}_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \delta DevIV_{i,t} + \phi' Z_{i,t} + \eta_{i,t+1}
\]
and whether ML primarily captures \(DevIV\) nonlinearities.

Robustness: subperiods; removing earnings announcement windows; alternative execution (buy at ask/sell at bid); constraints on leverage and position limits.

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words; includes descriptive statistics table)
**Primary dataset (verified access):** OptionMetrics IvyDB US via WRDS (Tilburg University access verified). Required fields: option bid/ask, implied vols, underlying prices, contract identifiers, open interest/volume.

**Sample design:**
- Focus on SPX options and/or a panel of liquid equity options.
- Use a consistent grid/bucketing for moneyness and maturity; exclude illiquid contracts with extreme spreads.
- Compute option returns using midquotes and implementable returns using bid/ask.

**Arbitrage-free reference surface:**
Construct \(\widehat{IV}^{AF}\) each day using an arbitrage-free surface method (repair layer or direct arbitrage-free surface such as SANOS-style representations). This ensures that deviation measures are not mechanically driven by arbitrage violations.

**Descriptive statistics table (to be filled):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P5 | P50 | P95 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Option return (mid, 1d) |  |  |  |  |  | per contract |
| Option return (exec, 1d) |  |  |  |  |  | buy at ask/sell at bid |
| Relative spread |  |  |  |  |  | (ask-bid)/mid |
| DevIV (vs AF surface) |  |  |  |  |  | mispricing proxy |
| Volume / open interest |  |  |  |  |  | capacity proxy |

Statistics will be reported for the full sample and for the traded subset (eligible contracts) to reflect actual portfolio constraints.

### Additional implementation notes (transaction costs, microstructure, and inference)
**Transaction costs and execution.** A central risk in option return predictability studies is that apparent alpha disappears once bid–ask spreads and price impact are included. I will therefore report results under multiple execution assumptions: (i) midquote returns (upper bound), (ii) buy-at-ask/sell-at-bid returns (implementable lower bound), and (iii) a conservative slippage add-on proportional to spread and portfolio turnover. Positions will be restricted to options with tight spreads and sufficient open interest, and I will report turnover and “holding-period alpha” to show whether signals survive realistic trading frequency.

**Cross-sectional dependence and standard errors.** Option returns are highly correlated within underlying and date. For predictive regressions and factor models I will use robust inference (e.g., Newey–West for time-series, and double-clustered standard errors by date and underlying for panels). Portfolio performance will be reported with bootstrap confidence intervals as a robustness check.

**Risk exposures vs mispricing.** To distinguish risk premia from mispricing, I will (i) control for known option risk proxies (delta, vega, gamma; IV level and skew; realized volatility), (ii) report exposures to market and volatility factors, and (iii) test whether returns concentrate in periods where risk premia are elevated (high VIX). If the long–short portfolio loads heavily on volatility risk, this suggests compensation rather than mispricing; if returns remain after controlling for exposures and costs, the evidence is closer to inefficiency.

**Model interpretability.** For tree-based models, feature importance and SHAP-style summaries (reported descriptively) will indicate whether the ML signal primarily uses surface-deviation measures (DevIV) or more standard characteristics. This helps connect the ML model back to economic mechanisms.

**Planned output tables/figures:** (1) summary performance table (gross/net Sharpe, turnover, max drawdown), (2) factor regression table with intercepts, (3) heatmap of average predicted returns over moneyness–maturity buckets, and (4) distribution of DevIV and subsequent returns to visualize whether deviations revert.

### Feasibility
The project is feasible within a master thesis timeline because it relies on standardized daily option data (IvyDB) and well-defined backtesting procedures. The main implementation burden is careful data cleaning and conservative cost modeling, both of which will be documented. Model complexity will be kept proportional to the incremental value it adds over transparent baselines.
