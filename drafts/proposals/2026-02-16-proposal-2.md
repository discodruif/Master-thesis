## Part 1 — Research Question (~200 words)
Delta hedging is a cornerstone of derivatives risk management, yet real-world hedging is performed under discrete rebalancing, transaction costs, and model error. Classical hedging rules derived from Black–Scholes assume frictionless markets and correct dynamics; empirically, these assumptions fail precisely when hedging matters most (high volatility regimes, jumps, liquidity shocks). Machine learning—especially deep reinforcement learning (DRL)—offers a way to learn *state-dependent* hedging policies that directly optimize an economic objective under realistic constraints.

**Research question:**

1) *Do risk-averse DRL hedging policies reduce tail hedging losses (e.g., CVaR of hedging error) relative to classical delta/vega hedging and risk-neutral DRL, when trained and evaluated on realistic option-market states from IvyDB US?*

2) *How sensitive are DRL hedging gains to transaction costs, rebalancing frequency, and market regimes?*

The thesis will focus on implementable hedging rules for liquid underlyings (SPX and/or highly traded equities). Economic significance will be assessed using hedging P\&L distributions, drawdowns, and turnover-adjusted performance. This is economically important for volatility funds and market makers, where risk management is driven by tail outcomes rather than average errors.

## Part 2 — Literature Review (MAX 1 PAGE)
The theoretical benchmark is continuous-time replication under no-arbitrage (Black & Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1973). In practice, discrete hedging and transaction costs create residual hedging error and invalidate perfect replication, motivating utility-based or risk-minimizing hedging criteria.

Recent finance/ML work reframes hedging as sequential decision-making. **Buehler et al. (2019, RFS)** (“Deep Hedging”) show that deep networks can learn hedging strategies that outperform classical delta hedging once frictions and constraints are included. Building on this, **Du et al. (2020, Journal of Financial Data Science)** study deep reinforcement learning for option replication and hedging under discrete trading and nonlinear transaction costs, highlighting that DRL can optimize a trading objective directly.

A key open question is the *risk criterion*: many RL implementations optimize expected P\&L (risk-neutral), while practitioners focus on tail risk. **Vittori, Trapletti, and Restelli (2020)** propose risk-averse RL for option hedging, showing that explicitly risk-sensitive objectives can improve hedging outcomes. The empirical finance literature suggests that downside risk and crash exposure are priced (e.g., skewness risk), making tail-focused hedging economically meaningful.

This thesis contributes by designing a risk-averse DRL hedging framework evaluated on an IvyDB-based state representation, and by quantifying how hedging performance varies across regimes and cost assumptions—providing a bridge between academic RL hedging demonstrations and implementable, data-grounded risk management.

## Part 3 — Research Plan (~500 words; includes regression equations)
### 3.1 Environment and state
Define a daily decision problem for hedging a fixed option position (or small option portfolio). At each day *t* the agent observes a state vector \(s_t\) containing:
- Option characteristics: moneyness \(k\), time-to-maturity \(\tau\), implied volatility level and skew measures.
- Underlying variables: price \(S_t\), realized volatility, returns, and market regime proxies (e.g., VIX level).
- Liquidity variables: option bid–ask, underlying spread proxies, open interest.

The agent chooses an action \(a_t\) representing hedge positions (e.g., number of shares \(h_t\), and possibly a secondary option hedge for vega exposure).

### 3.2 Reward and risk aversion
Let \(V_t\) be option value and \(\Pi_t\) be total hedged portfolio value. Daily hedging P\&L:
\[
\Delta \Pi_{t+1} = (V_{t+1}-V_t) + h_t (S_{t+1}-S_t) - TC_{t+1}
\]
Transaction costs \(TC_{t+1}\) are computed from turnover using half-spreads.

Risk-averse objective examples:
- Mean–variance: maximize \(\mathbb{E}[\Delta\Pi] - \lambda \mathrm{Var}(\Delta\Pi)\).
- CVaR: maximize \(-\mathrm{CVaR}_{\alpha}(-\Delta\Pi)\).

A risk-averse RL algorithm (or a risk-penalized reward) will be implemented to learn policies \(\pi(a|s)\) that trade off expected hedging P\&L and tail losses.

### 3.3 Benchmarks
- Black–Scholes delta hedging with implied vol inputs.
- Delta–vega hedging using an additional option.
- Risk-neutral DRL (expected P\&L reward).

### 3.4 Statistical tests and regressions
Contract-level hedging errors are computed:
\[
HE_{i,t+1} = \Delta \Pi_{i,t+1}
\]
(or absolute/negative-part losses). Test whether risk-averse DRL reduces downside losses relative to benchmarks with panel regressions:
\[
\text{Loss}_{i,t+1} = \alpha + \beta_1 \mathbb{1}[\text{RiskAverseDRL}] + \beta_2 \mathbb{1}[\text{RiskNeutralDRL}] + \Gamma' X_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t+1}
\]
where \(\text{Loss}\) is \(-HE\) for negative outcomes, \(|HE|\), or an indicator for tail events; \(X\) includes moneyness, maturity, liquidity, and regime controls.

To connect RL actions to interpretable hedging behavior, estimate:
\[
\Delta h_{i,t} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \Delta_{BS,i,t} + \theta_2 \text{Skew}_t + \theta_3 \text{Regime}_t + u_{i,t}
\]
This tests whether the learned policy behaves like “augmented delta hedging” with additional state dependence.

### 3.5 Robustness
- Stress testing under high VIX periods.
- Alternative transaction cost models.
- Different rebalancing frequencies (daily vs weekly).

## Part 4 — Data Sources (~400 words; includes descriptive statistics table)
**Primary dataset (verified access):** OptionMetrics IvyDB US via WRDS (Tilburg University access verified). This provides daily end-of-day option quotes, implied volatilities, and contract characteristics for U.S. index and equity options.

**Sample plan:**
- Underlying: SPX options (deep liquidity) as the main sample; optionally a robustness panel of mega-cap equities.
- Maturities: 7–180 days; moneyness: e.g., 0.8–1.2.
- Filters: exclude stale quotes (zero bid), extreme spreads, and contracts with missing key fields.

**Constructed variables:**
- Hedging costs from bid–ask spreads (half-spread × turnover).
- Regime proxies: VIX and realized vol.
- Skew features: 25Δ risk reversal or slope of IV across strikes.

**Descriptive statistics table (to be completed):**

| Variable | Mean | Std | P5 | P50 | P95 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Daily hedge turnover (|Δh|) |  |  |  |  |  | shares per option |
| Half-spread cost (option) |  |  |  |  |  | in $ or % |
| Hedging error (ΔΠ) |  |  |  |  |  | per contract |
| Tail loss (CVaR 95%) |  |  |  |  |  | by strategy |
| VIX level |  |  |  |  |  | regime proxy |

The thesis will report these statistics by regime (high vs low VIX) to show how frictions and hedging difficulty vary over time.

### Additional implementation details (training, evaluation, and interpretability)
**Training design.** I will train the DRL agent using a walk-forward scheme that mimics deployment: the policy is trained on an expanding window of historical states and then evaluated on a strictly later out-of-sample period. This reduces look-ahead bias and aligns with finance forecasting practice. I will compare at least two DRL families: (i) actor–critic methods with continuous actions (e.g., PPO/SAC-style), and (ii) distributional or quantile-based variants when optimizing tail objectives. Hyperparameters (network depth, learning rate, risk-aversion parameter \(\lambda\) or CVaR level \(\alpha\)) will be tuned using a validation set defined by time.

**Economic constraints.** Actions will be constrained to realistic bounds (e.g., maximum leverage in shares, discrete lot sizes), and transaction costs will be calculated from observable bid–ask spreads. To avoid “overtrading” artifacts, I will also include an explicit turnover penalty and report turnover as a main outcome.

**Outcome metrics.** Beyond mean hedging P\&L, I will report downside-focused metrics: (i) \(\mathrm{CVaR}_{95\%}\) of negative hedging P\&L, (ii) maximum drawdown of cumulative hedging P\&L, and (iii) hit rate of large-loss days. These are closer to the objectives of risk managers and volatility funds.

**Interpretability.** To understand what the agent learns, I will estimate policy sensitivity plots (partial dependence of hedge ratio on state variables such as moneyness, IV level, and skew) and test whether policy adjustments are concentrated in crisis regimes. This will help connect the DRL policy to economically interpretable mechanisms (e.g., “hedge more aggressively when skew steepens”).

### Identification and causal interpretation (limitations)
The thesis will interpret DRL performance improvements as *predictive/decision* gains rather than causal effects. Nevertheless, I will reduce confounding by (i) matching benchmark strategies to the same information set, (ii) using identical transaction cost assumptions across strategies, and (iii) evaluating performance separately for “training-like” and “stress” periods. I will also report sensitivity to alternative reward specifications to show that results are not driven by a single tuning choice. These design choices aim to make conclusions robust and suitable for a finance thesis, where external validity and economic plausibility are as important as algorithmic novelty.

**Planned deliverable:** a clear comparison table summarizing (a) average hedging P\&L, (b) volatility of hedging P\&L, (c) CVaR, and (d) turnover across all strategies, reported both gross and net of costs.
This will ensure the thesis makes a finance-relevant statement about risk management improvement, not only model fit.
