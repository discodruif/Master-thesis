## Part 1: Research Question

Can hybrid ensemble methods that combine machine learning models with traditional parametric approaches (Black-Scholes, Heston) deliver superior and more robust option pricing performance across diverse market regimes compared to either approach used independently?

The economic motivation stems from a fundamental trade-off in option pricing: traditional models offer theoretical grounding, interpretability, and stability but struggle with model misspecification; machine learning models offer flexibility and data-driven adaptation but risk overfitting and lack economic structure. Rather than viewing these as competing alternatives, this research investigates whether systematic combination can capture the strengths of both.

Specifically, I address three questions: (1) Can weighted ensemble methods that dynamically allocate between ML and traditional models based on market conditions improve pricing accuracy and reduce variance across volatility regimes? (2) Do ensemble approaches exhibit superior robustness during extreme market events (tail pricing accuracy, crash periods) where individual models fail? (3) What is the economic value of ensemble pricing in terms of hedging performance and trading strategy profitability?

This research contributes to the growing literature on model combination in finance and offers practical tools for derivatives pricing systems that must perform reliably across all market conditions.

## Part 2: Literature Review

The challenge of model uncertainty in option pricing is well-established. Cont (2006, *Quantitative Finance*) argues that no single model consistently explains all option market phenomena, motivating model combination approaches. Christoffersen & Jacobs (2004, *Review of Financial Studies*) demonstrate that different volatility models perform better in different regimes, suggesting regime-dependent weighting strategies.

Ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness, have a strong foundation in machine learning (Dietterich, 2000, *Machine Learning*; Breiman, 2001, *Machine Learning*). Applications to finance have shown consistent benefits. Ballings et al. (2015, *European Journal of Operational Research*) demonstrate that ensemble methods improve stock return prediction. Tan et al. (2025, *arXiv*) revisit ensemble methods for stock and crypto trading, showing effective performance in portfolio management and option pricing tasks.

Recent work on combining ML with traditional option pricing includes: Ivașcu (2021, *Expert Systems with Applications*, 109 citations) compares neural networks, random forests, and traditional models, finding that ML often outperforms but with regime-dependent advantages. Bloch (2019, *SSRN*) proposes hybrid approaches that use ML to correct parametric model mispricing. Fan & Sirignano (2024, *arXiv*) survey machine learning methods for derivative pricing and suggest that hybrid approaches may offer the best practical performance.

Despite this foundation, the literature lacks systematic evaluation of ensemble methods specifically designed for option pricing that: (1) adaptively weight models based on regime indicators, (2) evaluate performance across tail events and crashes, (3) assess economic value through hedging and trading applications. This research addresses these gaps comprehensively.

## Part 3: Research Plan

The research employs a three-component framework: ensemble architecture design, regime-adaptive weighting, and comprehensive empirical evaluation.

**Ensemble Architecture**

The ensemble combines three model classes:

1. **Traditional Parametric Models**: Black-Scholes, Heston stochastic volatility
2. **Tree-Based ML Models**: Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost), Random Forests
3. **Deep Learning Models**: Feed-forward neural networks, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)

For option $i$ with characteristics $(K_i, T_i, S_i, r_i)$, each model $m \in \{1, \ldots, M\}$ produces a price prediction $\hat{P}_{i,m}$. The ensemble prediction is:

$$
\hat{P}_i^{\text{ensemble}} = \sum_{m=1}^M w_{m,t} \cdot \hat{P}_{i,m}
$$

where $w_{m,t}$ are time-varying weights satisfying $\sum_{m=1}^M w_{m,t} = 1$ and $w_{m,t} \geq 0$.

**Regime-Adaptive Weighting**

Simple averaging ($w_{m,t} = 1/M$) ignores regime-specific strengths. I implement dynamic weighting based on recent performance and regime indicators:

$$
w_{m,t} = \frac{\exp\left(-\lambda \cdot \text{RMSE}_{m,t-H:t-1}\right) \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{Regime}_t)}{\sum_{m'=1}^M \exp\left(-\lambda \cdot \text{RMSE}_{m',t-H:t-1}\right) \cdot \mathbb{I}(\text{Regime}_t)}
$$

where $\text{RMSE}_{m,t-H:t-1}$ is model $m$'s error over the past $H$ days, $\lambda$ controls sensitivity, and $\mathbb{I}(\text{Regime}_t)$ incorporates regime-specific priors (e.g., higher weight on traditional models during extreme VIX).

Alternatively, I estimate weights via meta-regression:

$$
w_{m,t} = \text{softmax}\left(\mathbf{z}_t^T \boldsymbol{\beta}_m\right)
$$

where $\mathbf{z}_t$ contains regime indicators (VIX level, realized vol, term spread, put-call skew) and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_m$ are learned coefficients.

**Empirical Evaluation Framework**

**(1) Pricing Accuracy Regression**

$$
\text{Price Error}_{i,t} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \text{Ensemble}_{i,t} + \alpha_2 \text{BestSingle}_{i,t} + \alpha_3 \text{Moneyness}_{i,t} + \alpha_4 \text{Vol}_{t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

where $\text{BestSingle}_{i,t}$ is the ex-post best individual model for comparison. I hypothesize $\alpha_1 < \alpha_2$, indicating the ensemble outperforms even the best single model on average.

**(2) Regime-Conditional Performance**

To test robustness, I estimate separate regressions for each volatility regime:

$$
\text{Price Error}_{i,t}^{\text{High Vol}} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{Ensemble}_{i,t} + \text{Controls}_{i,t} + \eta_{i,t}
$$

Ensemble methods should show particular advantages in high-volatility regimes where individual models are more likely to fail.

**(3) Tail Event Analysis**

I evaluate performance during the 10 worst market days (largest VIX spikes) in the sample:

$$
\text{Extreme Error}_{i,t} = \delta_0 + \delta_1 \text{Ensemble}_{i,t} + \delta_2 \text{Traditional}_{i,t} + \delta_3 \text{ML}_{i,t} + \nu_{i,t}
$$

Superior tail performance would be reflected in $\delta_1$ being significantly lower than $\delta_2$ and $\delta_3$.

**(4) Economic Value Assessment**

Hedging performance is evaluated by constructing delta-hedged portfolios using Greeks from each pricing approach:

$$
\text{Hedging Variance}_{t} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{EnsembleGreeks}_{t} + \beta_2 \text{Vol}_{t} + \beta_3 \text{PortSize}_{t} + \epsilon_{t}
$$

Additionally, I construct a trading strategy that identifies mispricing relative to the ensemble prediction:

$$
\text{Signal}_{i,t} = P_{i,t}^{\text{market}} - \hat{P}_{i,t}^{\text{ensemble}}
$$

Trading when $|\text{Signal}_{i,t}| > \tau$ (transaction cost threshold), I evaluate risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio) and compare against benchmarks.
